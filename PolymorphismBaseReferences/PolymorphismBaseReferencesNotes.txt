//Polymorphism - Using Base Class References

Using Base class references
-We can also use Base class references with dynamic polymorphism
-Useful when we pass objects to functions that expect a Base class reference

Example) Using Base class references

Account a;
Account &ref = a;
ref.withdraw(1000);  //Account::withdraw

Trust t;
Account &ref1 = t;
ref1.withdraw(1000);  //Trust::withdraw

Example) Using Base class references

void do_withdraw(Account &account, double amount) 
{
    account.withdraw(amount);
}

Account a;
do_withdraw(a, 1000);  //Account::withdraw

Trust t;
do_withdraw(t, 1000);  //Trust::withdraw
