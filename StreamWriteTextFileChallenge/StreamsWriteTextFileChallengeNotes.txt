I/O and Streams - Writing to a Text File - Challenge

Copy Romeo and Juliet with Line numbers

This challenge should be pretty easy.
I have provided the text to Romeo and Juliet in a file named romeoandjuliet.txt

For this challenge you have to make a copy of the Romeo and Juliet file and save it to antoher file.
This new copy should have the line numbers at teh beginning of each line in the play.
Please formate the numbers nicely so everything lines up.

Feel free to extend this challenge any way you like.
For example, you may want to provide line numbers only for lines that actually have text.

Have fun!
