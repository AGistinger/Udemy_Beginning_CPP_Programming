1         PROLOGUE  
2         Two households, both alike in dignity,
3         In fair Verona, where we lay our scene,
4         From ancient grudge break to new mutiny,
5         Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.
6         From forth the fatal loins of these two foes
7         A pair of star-cross'd lovers take their life;
8         Whose misadventured piteous overthrows
9         Do with their death bury their parents' strife.
10        The fearful passage of their death-mark'd love,
11        And the continuance of their parents' rage,
12        Which, but their children's end, nought could remove,
13        Is now the two hours' traffic of our stage;
14        The which if you with patient ears attend,
15        What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend.
16        SCENE I. Verona. A public place.
17        Enter SAMPSON and GREGORY, of the house of Capulet, armed with swords and bucklers
18        SAMPSON   
19        Gregory, o' my word, we'll not carry coals.
20        GREGORY   
21        No, for then we should be colliers.
22        SAMPSON   
23        I mean, an we be in choler, we'll draw.
24        GREGORY   
25        Ay, while you live, draw your neck out o' the collar.
26        SAMPSON   
27        I strike quickly, being moved.
28        GREGORY   
29        But thou art not quickly moved to strike.
30        SAMPSON   
31        A dog of the house of Montague moves me.
32        GREGORY   
33        To move is to stir; and to be valiant is to stand:
34        therefore, if thou art moved, thou runn'st away.
35        SAMPSON   
36        A dog of that house shall move me to stand: I will
37        take the wall of any man or maid of Montague's.
38        GREGORY   
39        That shows thee a weak slave; for the weakest goes
40        to the wall.
41        SAMPSON   
42        True; and therefore women, being the weaker vessels,
43        are ever thrust to the wall: therefore I will push
44        Montague's men from the wall, and thrust his maids
45        to the wall.
46        GREGORY   
47        The quarrel is between our masters and us their men.
48        SAMPSON   
49        'Tis all one, I will show myself a tyrant: when I
50        have fought with the men, I will be cruel with the
51        maids, and cut off their heads.
52        GREGORY   
53        The heads of the maids?
54        SAMPSON   
55        Ay, the heads of the maids, or their maidenheads;
56        take it in what sense thou wilt.
57        GREGORY   
58        They must take it in sense that feel it.
59        SAMPSON   
60        Me they shall feel while I am able to stand: and
61        'tis known I am a pretty piece of flesh.
62        GREGORY   
63        'Tis well thou art not fish; if thou hadst, thou
64        hadst been poor John. Draw thy tool! here comes
65        two of the house of the Montagues.
66        SAMPSON   
67        My naked weapon is out: quarrel, I will back thee.
68        GREGORY   
69        How! turn thy back and run?
70        SAMPSON   
71        Fear me not.
72        GREGORY   
73        No, marry; I fear thee!
74        SAMPSON   
75        Let us take the law of our sides; let them begin.
76        GREGORY   
77        I will frown as I pass by, and let them take it as
78        they list.
79        SAMPSON   
80        Nay, as they dare. I will bite my thumb at them;
81        which is a disgrace to them, if they bear it.
82        Enter ABRAHAM and BALTHASAR

83        ABRAHAM   
84        Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?
85        SAMPSON   
86        I do bite my thumb, sir.
87        ABRAHAM   
88        Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?
89        SAMPSON   
90        [Aside to GREGORY] Is the law of our side, if I say
91        ay?       
92        GREGORY   
93        No.       
94        SAMPSON   
95        No, sir, I do not bite my thumb at you, sir, but I
96        bite my thumb, sir.
97        GREGORY   
98        Do you quarrel, sir?
99        ABRAHAM   
100       Quarrel sir! no, sir.
101       SAMPSON   
102       If you do, sir, I am for you: I serve as good a man as you.
103       ABRAHAM   
104       No better.
105       SAMPSON   
106       Well, sir.
107       GREGORY   
108       Say 'better:' here comes one of my master's kinsmen.
109       SAMPSON   
110       Yes, better, sir.
111       ABRAHAM   
112       You lie.  
113       SAMPSON   
114       Draw, if you be men. Gregory, remember thy swashing blow.
115       They fight

116       Enter BENVOLIO

117       BENVOLIO  
118       Part, fools!
119       Put up your swords; you know not what you do.
120       Beats down their swords

121       Enter TYBALT

122       TYBALT    
123       What, art thou drawn among these heartless hinds?
124       Turn thee, Benvolio, look upon thy death.
125       BENVOLIO  
126       I do but keep the peace: put up thy sword,
127       Or manage it to part these men with me.
128       TYBALT    
129       What, drawn, and talk of peace! I hate the word,
130       As I hate hell, all Montagues, and thee:
131       Have at thee, coward!
132       They fight

133       Enter, several of both houses, who join the fray; then enter Citizens, with clubs

134       First Citizen
135       Clubs, bills, and partisans! strike! beat them down!
136       Down with the Capulets! down with the Montagues!
137       Enter CAPULET in his gown, and LADY CAPULET

138       CAPULET   
139       What noise is this? Give me my long sword, ho!
140       LADY CAPULET
141       A crutch, a crutch! why call you for a sword?
142       CAPULET   
143       My sword, I say! Old Montague is come,
144       And flourishes his blade in spite of me.
145       Enter MONTAGUE and LADY MONTAGUE

146       MONTAGUE  
147       Thou villain Capulet,--Hold me not, let me go.
148       LADY MONTAGUE
149       Thou shalt not stir a foot to seek a foe.
150       Enter PRINCE, with Attendants

151       PRINCE    
152       Rebellious subjects, enemies to peace,
153       Profaners of this neighbour-stained steel,--
154       Will they not hear? What, ho! you men, you beasts,
155       That quench the fire of your pernicious rage
156       With purple fountains issuing from your veins,
157       On pain of torture, from those bloody hands
158       Throw your mistemper'd weapons to the ground,
159       And hear the sentence of your moved prince.
160       Three civil brawls, bred of an airy word,
161       By thee, old Capulet, and Montague,
162       Have thrice disturb'd the quiet of our streets,
163       And made Verona's ancient citizens
164       Cast by their grave beseeming ornaments,
165       To wield old partisans, in hands as old,
166       Canker'd with peace, to part your canker'd hate:
167       If ever you disturb our streets again,
168       Your lives shall pay the forfeit of the peace.
169       For this time, all the rest depart away:
170       You Capulet; shall go along with me:
171       And, Montague, come you this afternoon,
172       To know our further pleasure in this case,
173       To old Free-town, our common judgment-place.
174       Once more, on pain of death, all men depart.
175       Exeunt all but MONTAGUE, LADY MONTAGUE, and BENVOLIO

176       MONTAGUE  
177       Who set this ancient quarrel new abroach?
178       Speak, nephew, were you by when it began?
179       BENVOLIO  
180       Here were the servants of your adversary,
181       And yours, close fighting ere I did approach:
182       I drew to part them: in the instant came
183       The fiery Tybalt, with his sword prepared,
184       Which, as he breathed defiance to my ears,
185       He swung about his head and cut the winds,
186       Who nothing hurt withal hiss'd him in scorn:
187       While we were interchanging thrusts and blows,
188       Came more and more and fought on part and part,
189       Till the prince came, who parted either part.
190       LADY MONTAGUE
191       O, where is Romeo? saw you him to-day?
192       Right glad I am he was not at this fray.
193       BENVOLIO  
194       Madam, an hour before the worshipp'd sun
195       Peer'd forth the golden window of the east,
196       A troubled mind drave me to walk abroad;
197       Where, underneath the grove of sycamore
198       That westward rooteth from the city's side,
199       So early walking did I see your son:
200       Towards him I made, but he was ware of me
201       And stole into the covert of the wood:
202       I, measuring his affections by my own,
203       That most are busied when they're most alone,
204       Pursued my humour not pursuing his,
205       And gladly shunn'd who gladly fled from me.
206       MONTAGUE  
207       Many a morning hath he there been seen,
208       With tears augmenting the fresh morning dew.
209       Adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs;
210       But all so soon as the all-cheering sun
211       Should in the furthest east begin to draw
212       The shady curtains from Aurora's bed,
213       Away from the light steals home my heavy son,
214       And private in his chamber pens himself,
215       Shuts up his windows, locks far daylight out
216       And makes himself an artificial night:
217       Black and portentous must this humour prove,
218       Unless good counsel may the cause remove.
219       BENVOLIO  
220       My noble uncle, do you know the cause?
221       MONTAGUE  
222       I neither know it nor can learn of him.
223       BENVOLIO  
224       Have you importuned him by any means?
225       MONTAGUE  
226       Both by myself and many other friends:
227       But he, his own affections' counsellor,
228       Is to himself--I will not say how true--
229       But to himself so secret and so close,
230       So far from sounding and discovery,
231       As is the bud bit with an envious worm,
232       Ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air,
233       Or dedicate his beauty to the sun.
234       Could we but learn from whence his sorrows grow.
235       We would as willingly give cure as know.
236       Enter ROMEO

237       BENVOLIO  
238       See, where he comes: so please you, step aside;
239       I'll know his grievance, or be much denied.
240       MONTAGUE  
241       I would thou wert so happy by thy stay,
242       To hear true shrift. Come, madam, let's away.
243       Exeunt MONTAGUE and LADY MONTAGUE

244       BENVOLIO  
245       Good-morrow, cousin.
246       ROMEO     
247       Is the day so young?
248       BENVOLIO  
249       But new struck nine.
250       ROMEO     
251       Ay me! sad hours seem long.
252       Was that my father that went hence so fast?
253       BENVOLIO  
254       It was. What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours?
255       ROMEO     
256       Not having that, which, having, makes them short.
257       BENVOLIO  
258       In love?  
259       ROMEO     
260       Out--     
261       BENVOLIO  
262       Of love?  
263       ROMEO     
264       Out of her favour, where I am in love.
265       BENVOLIO  
266       Alas, that love, so gentle in his view,
267       Should be so tyrannous and rough in proof!
268       ROMEO     
269       Alas, that love, whose view is muffled still,
270       Should, without eyes, see pathways to his will!
271       Where shall we dine? O me! What fray was here?
272       Yet tell me not, for I have heard it all.
273       Here's much to do with hate, but more with love.
274       Why, then, O brawling love! O loving hate!
275       O any thing, of nothing first create!
276       O heavy lightness! serious vanity!
277       Mis-shapen chaos of well-seeming forms!
278       Feather of lead, bright smoke, cold fire,
279       sick health!
280       Still-waking sleep, that is not what it is!
281       This love feel I, that feel no love in this.
282       Dost thou not laugh?
283       BENVOLIO  
284       No, coz, I rather weep.
285       ROMEO     
286       Good heart, at what?
287       BENVOLIO  
288       At thy good heart's oppression.
289       ROMEO     
290       Why, such is love's transgression.
291       Griefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast,
292       Which thou wilt propagate, to have it prest
293       With more of thine: this love that thou hast shown
294       Doth add more grief to too much of mine own.
295       Love is a smoke raised with the fume of sighs;
296       Being purged, a fire sparkling in lovers' eyes;
297       Being vex'd a sea nourish'd with lovers' tears:
298       What is it else? a madness most discreet,
299       A choking gall and a preserving sweet.
300       Farewell, my coz.
301       BENVOLIO  
302       Soft! I will go along;
303       An if you leave me so, you do me wrong.
304       ROMEO     
305       Tut, I have lost myself; I am not here;
306       This is not Romeo, he's some other where.
307       BENVOLIO  
308       Tell me in sadness, who is that you love.
309       ROMEO     
310       What, shall I groan and tell thee?
311       BENVOLIO  
312       Groan! why, no.
313       But sadly tell me who.
314       ROMEO     
315       Bid a sick man in sadness make his will:
316       Ah, word ill urged to one that is so ill!
317       In sadness, cousin, I do love a woman.
318       BENVOLIO  
319       I aim'd so near, when I supposed you loved.
320       ROMEO     
321       A right good mark-man! And she's fair I love.
322       BENVOLIO  
323       A right fair mark, fair coz, is soonest hit.
324       ROMEO     
325       Well, in that hit you miss: she'll not be hit
326       With Cupid's arrow; she hath Dian's wit;
327       And, in strong proof of chastity well arm'd,
328       From love's weak childish bow she lives unharm'd.
329       She will not stay the siege of loving terms,
330       Nor bide the encounter of assailing eyes,
331       Nor ope her lap to saint-seducing gold:
332       O, she is rich in beauty, only poor,
333       That when she dies with beauty dies her store.
334       BENVOLIO  
335       Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste?
336       ROMEO     
337       She hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste,
338       For beauty starved with her severity
339       Cuts beauty off from all posterity.
340       She is too fair, too wise, wisely too fair,
341       To merit bliss by making me despair:
342       She hath forsworn to love, and in that vow
343       Do I live dead that live to tell it now.
344       BENVOLIO  
345       Be ruled by me, forget to think of her.
346       ROMEO     
347       O, teach me how I should forget to think.
348       BENVOLIO  
349       By giving liberty unto thine eyes;
350       Examine other beauties.
351       ROMEO     
352       'Tis the way
353       To call hers exquisite, in question more:
354       These happy masks that kiss fair ladies' brows
355       Being black put us in mind they hide the fair;
356       He that is strucken blind cannot forget
357       The precious treasure of his eyesight lost:
358       Show me a mistress that is passing fair,
359       What doth her beauty serve, but as a note
360       Where I may read who pass'd that passing fair?
361       Farewell: thou canst not teach me to forget.
362       BENVOLIO  
363       I'll pay that doctrine, or else die in debt.
364       Exeunt    

365       SCENE II. A street.
366       Enter CAPULET, PARIS, and Servant
367       CAPULET   
368       But Montague is bound as well as I,
369       In penalty alike; and 'tis not hard, I think,
370       For men so old as we to keep the peace.
371       PARIS     
372       Of honourable reckoning are you both;
373       And pity 'tis you lived at odds so long.
374       But now, my lord, what say you to my suit?
375       CAPULET   
376       But saying o'er what I have said before:
377       My child is yet a stranger in the world;
378       She hath not seen the change of fourteen years,
379       Let two more summers wither in their pride,
380       Ere we may think her ripe to be a bride.
381       PARIS     
382       Younger than she are happy mothers made.
383       CAPULET   
384       And too soon marr'd are those so early made.
385       The earth hath swallow'd all my hopes but she,
386       She is the hopeful lady of my earth:
387       But woo her, gentle Paris, get her heart,
388       My will to her consent is but a part;
389       An she agree, within her scope of choice
390       Lies my consent and fair according voice.
391       This night I hold an old accustom'd feast,
392       Whereto I have invited many a guest,
393       Such as I love; and you, among the store,
394       One more, most welcome, makes my number more.
395       At my poor house look to behold this night
396       Earth-treading stars that make dark heaven light:
397       Such comfort as do lusty young men feel
398       When well-apparell'd April on the heel
399       Of limping winter treads, even such delight
400       Among fresh female buds shall you this night
401       Inherit at my house; hear all, all see,
402       And like her most whose merit most shall be:
403       Which on more view, of many mine being one
404       May stand in number, though in reckoning none,
405       Come, go with me.
406       To Servant, giving a paper

407       Go, sirrah, trudge about
408       Through fair Verona; find those persons out
409       Whose names are written there, and to them say,
410       My house and welcome on their pleasure stay.
411       Exeunt CAPULET and PARIS

412       Servant   
413       Find them out whose names are written here! It is
414       written, that the shoemaker should meddle with his
415       yard, and the tailor with his last, the fisher with
416       his pencil, and the painter with his nets; but I am
417       sent to find those persons whose names are here
418       writ, and can never find what names the writing
419       person hath here writ. I must to the learned.--In good time.
420       Enter BENVOLIO and ROMEO

421       BENVOLIO  
422       Tut, man, one fire burns out another's burning,
423       One pain is lessen'd by another's anguish;
424       Turn giddy, and be holp by backward turning;
425       One desperate grief cures with another's languish:
426       Take thou some new infection to thy eye,
427       And the rank poison of the old will die.
428       ROMEO     
429       Your plaintain-leaf is excellent for that.
430       BENVOLIO  
431       For what, I pray thee?
432       ROMEO     
433       For your broken shin.
434       BENVOLIO  
435       Why, Romeo, art thou mad?
436       ROMEO     
437       Not mad, but bound more than a mad-man is;
438       Shut up in prison, kept without my food,
439       Whipp'd and tormented and--God-den, good fellow.
440       Servant   
441       God gi' god-den. I pray, sir, can you read?
442       ROMEO     
443       Ay, mine own fortune in my misery.
444       Servant   
445       Perhaps you have learned it without book: but, I
446       pray, can you read any thing you see?
447       ROMEO     
448       Ay, if I know the letters and the language.
449       Servant   
450       Ye say honestly: rest you merry!
451       ROMEO     
452       Stay, fellow; I can read.
453       Reads     

454       'Signior Martino and his wife and daughters;
455       County Anselme and his beauteous sisters; the lady
456       widow of Vitravio; Signior Placentio and his lovely
457       nieces; Mercutio and his brother Valentine; mine
458       uncle Capulet, his wife and daughters; my fair niece
459       Rosaline; Livia; Signior Valentio and his cousin
460       Tybalt, Lucio and the lively Helena.' A fair
461       assembly: whither should they come?
462       Servant   
463       Up.       
464       ROMEO     
465       Whither?  
466       Servant   
467       To supper; to our house.
468       ROMEO     
469       Whose house?
470       Servant   
471       My master's.
472       ROMEO     
473       Indeed, I should have ask'd you that before.
474       Servant   
475       Now I'll tell you without asking: my master is the
476       great rich Capulet; and if you be not of the house
477       of Montagues, I pray, come and crush a cup of wine.
478       Rest you merry!
479       Exit      

480       BENVOLIO  
481       At this same ancient feast of Capulet's
482       Sups the fair Rosaline whom thou so lovest,
483       With all the admired beauties of Verona:
484       Go thither; and, with unattainted eye,
485       Compare her face with some that I shall show,
486       And I will make thee think thy swan a crow.
487       ROMEO     
488       When the devout religion of mine eye
489       Maintains such falsehood, then turn tears to fires;
490       And these, who often drown'd could never die,
491       Transparent heretics, be burnt for liars!
492       One fairer than my love! the all-seeing sun
493       Ne'er saw her match since first the world begun.
494       BENVOLIO  
495       Tut, you saw her fair, none else being by,
496       Herself poised with herself in either eye:
497       But in that crystal scales let there be weigh'd
498       Your lady's love against some other maid
499       That I will show you shining at this feast,
500       And she shall scant show well that now shows best.
501       ROMEO     
502       I'll go along, no such sight to be shown,
503       But to rejoice in splendor of mine own.
504       Exeunt    

505       SCENE III. A room in Capulet's house.
506       Enter LADY CAPULET and Nurse
507       LADY CAPULET
508       Nurse, where's my daughter? call her forth to me.
509       Nurse     
510       Now, by my maidenhead, at twelve year old,
511       I bade her come. What, lamb! what, ladybird!
512       God forbid! Where's this girl? What, Juliet!
513       Enter JULIET

514       JULIET    
515       How now! who calls?
516       Nurse     
517       Your mother.
518       JULIET    
519       Madam, I am here.
520       What is your will?
521       LADY CAPULET
522       This is the matter:--Nurse, give leave awhile,
523       We must talk in secret:--nurse, come back again;
524       I have remember'd me, thou's hear our counsel.
525       Thou know'st my daughter's of a pretty age.
526       Nurse     
527       Faith, I can tell her age unto an hour.
528       LADY CAPULET
529       She's not fourteen.
530       Nurse     
531       I'll lay fourteen of my teeth,--
532       And yet, to my teeth be it spoken, I have but four--
533       She is not fourteen. How long is it now
534       To Lammas-tide?
535       LADY CAPULET
536       A fortnight and odd days.
537       Nurse     
538       Even or odd, of all days in the year,
539       Come Lammas-eve at night shall she be fourteen.
540       Susan and she--God rest all Christian souls!--
541       Were of an age: well, Susan is with God;
542       She was too good for me: but, as I said,
543       On Lammas-eve at night shall she be fourteen;
544       That shall she, marry; I remember it well.
545       'Tis since the earthquake now eleven years;
546       And she was wean'd,--I never shall forget it,--
547       Of all the days of the year, upon that day:
548       For I had then laid wormwood to my dug,
549       Sitting in the sun under the dove-house wall;
550       My lord and you were then at Mantua:--
551       Nay, I do bear a brain:--but, as I said,
552       When it did taste the wormwood on the nipple
553       Of my dug and felt it bitter, pretty fool,
554       To see it tetchy and fall out with the dug!
555       Shake quoth the dove-house: 'twas no need, I trow,
556       To bid me trudge:
557       And since that time it is eleven years;
558       For then she could stand alone; nay, by the rood,
559       She could have run and waddled all about;
560       For even the day before, she broke her brow:
561       And then my husband--God be with his soul!
562       A' was a merry man--took up the child:
563       'Yea,' quoth he, 'dost thou fall upon thy face?
564       Thou wilt fall backward when thou hast more wit;
565       Wilt thou not, Jule?' and, by my holidame,
566       The pretty wretch left crying and said 'Ay.'
567       To see, now, how a jest shall come about!
568       I warrant, an I should live a thousand years,
569       I never should forget it: 'Wilt thou not, Jule?' quoth he;
570       And, pretty fool, it stinted and said 'Ay.'
571       LADY CAPULET
572       Enough of this; I pray thee, hold thy peace.
573       Nurse     
574       Yes, madam: yet I cannot choose but laugh,
575       To think it should leave crying and say 'Ay.'
576       And yet, I warrant, it had upon its brow
577       A bump as big as a young cockerel's stone;
578       A parlous knock; and it cried bitterly:
579       'Yea,' quoth my husband,'fall'st upon thy face?
580       Thou wilt fall backward when thou comest to age;
581       Wilt thou not, Jule?' it stinted and said 'Ay.'
582       JULIET    
583       And stint thou too, I pray thee, nurse, say I.
584       Nurse     
585       Peace, I have done. God mark thee to his grace!
586       Thou wast the prettiest babe that e'er I nursed:
587       An I might live to see thee married once,
588       I have my wish.
589       LADY CAPULET
590       Marry, that 'marry' is the very theme
591       I came to talk of. Tell me, daughter Juliet,
592       How stands your disposition to be married?
593       JULIET    
594       It is an honour that I dream not of.
595       Nurse     
596       An honour! were not I thine only nurse,
597       I would say thou hadst suck'd wisdom from thy teat.
598       LADY CAPULET
599       Well, think of marriage now; younger than you,
600       Here in Verona, ladies of esteem,
601       Are made already mothers: by my count,
602       I was your mother much upon these years
603       That you are now a maid. Thus then in brief:
604       The valiant Paris seeks you for his love.
605       Nurse     
606       A man, young lady! lady, such a man
607       As all the world--why, he's a man of wax.
608       LADY CAPULET
609       Verona's summer hath not such a flower.
610       Nurse     
611       Nay, he's a flower; in faith, a very flower.
612       LADY CAPULET
613       What say you? can you love the gentleman?
614       This night you shall behold him at our feast;
615       Read o'er the volume of young Paris' face,
616       And find delight writ there with beauty's pen;
617       Examine every married lineament,
618       And see how one another lends content
619       And what obscured in this fair volume lies
620       Find written in the margent of his eyes.
621       This precious book of love, this unbound lover,
622       To beautify him, only lacks a cover:
623       The fish lives in the sea, and 'tis much pride
624       For fair without the fair within to hide:
625       That book in many's eyes doth share the glory,
626       That in gold clasps locks in the golden story;
627       So shall you share all that he doth possess,
628       By having him, making yourself no less.
629       Nurse     
630       No less! nay, bigger; women grow by men.
631       LADY CAPULET
632       Speak briefly, can you like of Paris' love?
633       JULIET    
634       I'll look to like, if looking liking move:
635       But no more deep will I endart mine eye
636       Than your consent gives strength to make it fly.
637       Enter a Servant

638       Servant   
639       Madam, the guests are come, supper served up, you
640       called, my young lady asked for, the nurse cursed in
641       the pantry, and every thing in extremity. I must
642       hence to wait; I beseech you, follow straight.
643       LADY CAPULET
644       We follow thee.
645       Exit Servant

646       Juliet, the county stays.
647       Nurse     
648       Go, girl, seek happy nights to happy days.
649       Exeunt    

650       SCENE IV. A street.
651       Enter ROMEO, MERCUTIO, BENVOLIO, with five or six Maskers, Torch-bearers, and others
652       ROMEO     
653       What, shall this speech be spoke for our excuse?
654       Or shall we on without a apology?
655       BENVOLIO  
656       The date is out of such prolixity:
657       We'll have no Cupid hoodwink'd with a scarf,
658       Bearing a Tartar's painted bow of lath,
659       Scaring the ladies like a crow-keeper;
660       Nor no without-book prologue, faintly spoke
661       After the prompter, for our entrance:
662       But let them measure us by what they will;
663       We'll measure them a measure, and be gone.
664       ROMEO     
665       Give me a torch: I am not for this ambling;
666       Being but heavy, I will bear the light.
667       MERCUTIO  
668       Nay, gentle Romeo, we must have you dance.
669       ROMEO     
670       Not I, believe me: you have dancing shoes
671       With nimble soles: I have a soul of lead
672       So stakes me to the ground I cannot move.
673       MERCUTIO  
674       You are a lover; borrow Cupid's wings,
675       And soar with them above a common bound.
676       ROMEO     
677       I am too sore enpierced with his shaft
678       To soar with his light feathers, and so bound,
679       I cannot bound a pitch above dull woe:
680       Under love's heavy burden do I sink.
681       MERCUTIO  
682       And, to sink in it, should you burden love;
683       Too great oppression for a tender thing.
684       ROMEO     
685       Is love a tender thing? it is too rough,
686       Too rude, too boisterous, and it pricks like thorn.
687       MERCUTIO  
688       If love be rough with you, be rough with love;
689       Prick love for pricking, and you beat love down.
690       Give me a case to put my visage in:
691       A visor for a visor! what care I
692       What curious eye doth quote deformities?
693       Here are the beetle brows shall blush for me.
694       BENVOLIO  
695       Come, knock and enter; and no sooner in,
696       But every man betake him to his legs.
697       ROMEO     
698       A torch for me: let wantons light of heart
699       Tickle the senseless rushes with their heels,
700       For I am proverb'd with a grandsire phrase;
701       I'll be a candle-holder, and look on.
702       The game was ne'er so fair, and I am done.
703       MERCUTIO  
704       Tut, dun's the mouse, the constable's own word:
705       If thou art dun, we'll draw thee from the mire
706       Of this sir-reverence love, wherein thou stick'st
707       Up to the ears. Come, we burn daylight, ho!
708       ROMEO     
709       Nay, that's not so.
710       MERCUTIO  
711       I mean, sir, in delay
712       We waste our lights in vain, like lamps by day.
713       Take our good meaning, for our judgment sits
714       Five times in that ere once in our five wits.
715       ROMEO     
716       And we mean well in going to this mask;
717       But 'tis no wit to go.
718       MERCUTIO  
719       Why, may one ask?
720       ROMEO     
721       I dream'd a dream to-night.
722       MERCUTIO  
723       And so did I.
724       ROMEO     
725       Well, what was yours?
726       MERCUTIO  
727       That dreamers often lie.
728       ROMEO     
729       In bed asleep, while they do dream things true.
730       MERCUTIO  
731       O, then, I see Queen Mab hath been with you.
732       She is the fairies' midwife, and she comes
733       In shape no bigger than an agate-stone
734       On the fore-finger of an alderman,
735       Drawn with a team of little atomies
736       Athwart men's noses as they lie asleep;
737       Her wagon-spokes made of long spiders' legs,
738       The cover of the wings of grasshoppers,
739       The traces of the smallest spider's web,
740       The collars of the moonshine's watery beams,
741       Her whip of cricket's bone, the lash of film,
742       Her wagoner a small grey-coated gnat,
743       Not so big as a round little worm
744       Prick'd from the lazy finger of a maid;
745       Her chariot is an empty hazel-nut
746       Made by the joiner squirrel or old grub,
747       Time out o' mind the fairies' coachmakers.
748       And in this state she gallops night by night
749       Through lovers' brains, and then they dream of love;
750       O'er courtiers' knees, that dream on court'sies straight,
751       O'er lawyers' fingers, who straight dream on fees,
752       O'er ladies ' lips, who straight on kisses dream,
753       Which oft the angry Mab with blisters plagues,
754       Because their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are:
755       Sometime she gallops o'er a courtier's nose,
756       And then dreams he of smelling out a suit;
757       And sometime comes she with a tithe-pig's tail
758       Tickling a parson's nose as a' lies asleep,
759       Then dreams, he of another benefice:
760       Sometime she driveth o'er a soldier's neck,
761       And then dreams he of cutting foreign throats,
762       Of breaches, ambuscadoes, Spanish blades,
763       Of healths five-fathom deep; and then anon
764       Drums in his ear, at which he starts and wakes,
765       And being thus frighted swears a prayer or two
766       And sleeps again. This is that very Mab
767       That plats the manes of horses in the night,
768       And bakes the elflocks in foul sluttish hairs,
769       Which once untangled, much misfortune bodes:
770       This is the hag, when maids lie on their backs,
771       That presses them and learns them first to bear,
772       Making them women of good carriage:
773       This is she--
774       ROMEO     
775       Peace, peace, Mercutio, peace!
776       Thou talk'st of nothing.
777       MERCUTIO  
778       True, I talk of dreams,
779       Which are the children of an idle brain,
780       Begot of nothing but vain fantasy,
781       Which is as thin of substance as the air
782       And more inconstant than the wind, who wooes
783       Even now the frozen bosom of the north,
784       And, being anger'd, puffs away from thence,
785       Turning his face to the dew-dropping south.
786       BENVOLIO  
787       This wind, you talk of, blows us from ourselves;
788       Supper is done, and we shall come too late.
789       ROMEO     
790       I fear, too early: for my mind misgives
791       Some consequence yet hanging in the stars
792       Shall bitterly begin his fearful date
793       With this night's revels and expire the term
794       Of a despised life closed in my breast
795       By some vile forfeit of untimely death.
796       But He, that hath the steerage of my course,
797       Direct my sail! On, lusty gentlemen.
798       BENVOLIO  
799       Strike, drum.
800       Exeunt    

801       SCENE V. A hall in Capulet's house.
802       Musicians waiting. Enter Servingmen with napkins
803       First Servant
804       Where's Potpan, that he helps not to take away? He
805       shift a trencher? he scrape a trencher!
806       Second Servant
807       When good manners shall lie all in one or two men's
808       hands and they unwashed too, 'tis a foul thing.
809       First Servant
810       Away with the joint-stools, remove the
811       court-cupboard, look to the plate. Good thou, save
812       me a piece of marchpane; and, as thou lovest me, let
813       the porter let in Susan Grindstone and Nell.
814       Antony, and Potpan!
815       Second Servant
816       Ay, boy, ready.
817       First Servant
818       You are looked for and called for, asked for and
819       sought for, in the great chamber.
820       Second Servant
821       We cannot be here and there too. Cheerly, boys; be
822       brisk awhile, and the longer liver take all.
823       Enter CAPULET, with JULIET and others of his house, meeting the Guests and Maskers

824       CAPULET   
825       Welcome, gentlemen! ladies that have their toes
826       Unplagued with corns will have a bout with you.
827       Ah ha, my mistresses! which of you all
828       Will now deny to dance? she that makes dainty,
829       She, I'll swear, hath corns; am I come near ye now?
830       Welcome, gentlemen! I have seen the day
831       That I have worn a visor and could tell
832       A whispering tale in a fair lady's ear,
833       Such as would please: 'tis gone, 'tis gone, 'tis gone:
834       You are welcome, gentlemen! come, musicians, play.
835       A hall, a hall! give room! and foot it, girls.
836       Music plays, and they dance

837       More light, you knaves; and turn the tables up,
838       And quench the fire, the room is grown too hot.
839       Ah, sirrah, this unlook'd-for sport comes well.
840       Nay, sit, nay, sit, good cousin Capulet;
841       For you and I are past our dancing days:
842       How long is't now since last yourself and I
843       Were in a mask?
844       Second Capulet
845       By'r lady, thirty years.
846       CAPULET   
847       What, man! 'tis not so much, 'tis not so much:
848       'Tis since the nuptials of Lucentio,
849       Come pentecost as quickly as it will,
850       Some five and twenty years; and then we mask'd.
851       Second Capulet
852       'Tis more, 'tis more, his son is elder, sir;
853       His son is thirty.
854       CAPULET   
855       Will you tell me that?
856       His son was but a ward two years ago.
857       ROMEO     
858       [To a Servingman] What lady is that, which doth
859       enrich the hand
860       Of yonder knight?
861       Servant   
862       I know not, sir.
863       ROMEO     
864       O, she doth teach the torches to burn bright!
865       It seems she hangs upon the cheek of night
866       Like a rich jewel in an Ethiope's ear;
867       Beauty too rich for use, for earth too dear!
868       So shows a snowy dove trooping with crows,
869       As yonder lady o'er her fellows shows.
870       The measure done, I'll watch her place of stand,
871       And, touching hers, make blessed my rude hand.
872       Did my heart love till now? forswear it, sight!
873       For I ne'er saw true beauty till this night.
874       TYBALT    
875       This, by his voice, should be a Montague.
876       Fetch me my rapier, boy. What dares the slave
877       Come hither, cover'd with an antic face,
878       To fleer and scorn at our solemnity?
879       Now, by the stock and honour of my kin,
880       To strike him dead, I hold it not a sin.
881       CAPULET   
882       Why, how now, kinsman! wherefore storm you so?
883       TYBALT    
884       Uncle, this is a Montague, our foe,
885       A villain that is hither come in spite,
886       To scorn at our solemnity this night.
887       CAPULET   
888       Young Romeo is it?
889       TYBALT    
890       'Tis he, that villain Romeo.
891       CAPULET   
892       Content thee, gentle coz, let him alone;
893       He bears him like a portly gentleman;
894       And, to say truth, Verona brags of him
895       To be a virtuous and well-govern'd youth:
896       I would not for the wealth of all the town
897       Here in my house do him disparagement:
898       Therefore be patient, take no note of him:
899       It is my will, the which if thou respect,
900       Show a fair presence and put off these frowns,
901       And ill-beseeming semblance for a feast.
902       TYBALT    
903       It fits, when such a villain is a guest:
904       I'll not endure him.
905       CAPULET   
906       He shall be endured:
907       What, goodman boy! I say, he shall: go to;
908       Am I the master here, or you? go to.
909       You'll not endure him! God shall mend my soul!
910       You'll make a mutiny among my guests!
911       You will set cock-a-hoop! you'll be the man!
912       TYBALT    
913       Why, uncle, 'tis a shame.
914       CAPULET   
915       Go to, go to;
916       You are a saucy boy: is't so, indeed?
917       This trick may chance to scathe you, I know what:
918       You must contrary me! marry, 'tis time.
919       Well said, my hearts! You are a princox; go:
920       Be quiet, or--More light, more light! For shame!
921       I'll make you quiet. What, cheerly, my hearts!
922       TYBALT    
923       Patience perforce with wilful choler meeting
924       Makes my flesh tremble in their different greeting.
925       I will withdraw: but this intrusion shall
926       Now seeming sweet convert to bitter gall.
927       Exit      

928       ROMEO     
929       [To JULIET] If I profane with my unworthiest hand
930       This holy shrine, the gentle fine is this:
931       My lips, two blushing pilgrims, ready stand
932       To smooth that rough touch with a tender kiss.
933       JULIET    
934       Good pilgrim, you do wrong your hand too much,
935       Which mannerly devotion shows in this;
936       For saints have hands that pilgrims' hands do touch,
937       And palm to palm is holy palmers' kiss.
938       ROMEO     
939       Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?
940       JULIET    
941       Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer.
942       ROMEO     
943       O, then, dear saint, let lips do what hands do;
944       They pray, grant thou, lest faith turn to despair.
945       JULIET    
946       Saints do not move, though grant for prayers' sake.
947       ROMEO     
948       Then move not, while my prayer's effect I take.
949       Thus from my lips, by yours, my sin is purged.
950       JULIET    
951       Then have my lips the sin that they have took.
952       ROMEO     
953       Sin from thy lips? O trespass sweetly urged!
954       Give me my sin again.
955       JULIET    
956       You kiss by the book.
957       Nurse     
958       Madam, your mother craves a word with you.
959       ROMEO     
960       What is her mother?
961       Nurse     
962       Marry, bachelor,
963       Her mother is the lady of the house,
964       And a good lady, and a wise and virtuous
965       I nursed her daughter, that you talk'd withal;
966       I tell you, he that can lay hold of her
967       Shall have the chinks.
968       ROMEO     
969       Is she a Capulet?
970       O dear account! my life is my foe's debt.
971       BENVOLIO  
972       Away, begone; the sport is at the best.
973       ROMEO     
974       Ay, so I fear; the more is my unrest.
975       CAPULET   
976       Nay, gentlemen, prepare not to be gone;
977       We have a trifling foolish banquet towards.
978       Is it e'en so? why, then, I thank you all
979       I thank you, honest gentlemen; good night.
980       More torches here! Come on then, let's to bed.
981       Ah, sirrah, by my fay, it waxes late:
982       I'll to my rest.
983       Exeunt all but JULIET and Nurse

984       JULIET    
985       Come hither, nurse. What is yond gentleman?
986       Nurse     
987       The son and heir of old Tiberio.
988       JULIET    
989       What's he that now is going out of door?
990       Nurse     
991       Marry, that, I think, be young Petrucio.
992       JULIET    
993       What's he that follows there, that would not dance?
994       Nurse     
995       I know not.
996       JULIET    
997       Go ask his name: if he be married.
998       My grave is like to be my wedding bed.
999       Nurse     
1000      His name is Romeo, and a Montague;
1001      The only son of your great enemy.
1002      JULIET    
1003      My only love sprung from my only hate!
1004      Too early seen unknown, and known too late!
1005      Prodigious birth of love it is to me,
1006      That I must love a loathed enemy.
1007      Nurse     
1008      What's this? what's this?
1009      JULIET    
1010      A rhyme I learn'd even now
1011      Of one I danced withal.
1012      One calls within 'Juliet.'

1013      Nurse     
1014      Anon, anon!
1015      Come, let's away; the strangers all are gone.
1016      Exeunt    

1017      ACT II    
1018      PROLOGUE  
1019      Enter Chorus
1020      Chorus    
1021      Now old desire doth in his death-bed lie,
1022      And young affection gapes to be his heir;
1023      That fair for which love groan'd for and would die,
1024      With tender Juliet match'd, is now not fair.
1025      Now Romeo is beloved and loves again,
1026      Alike betwitched by the charm of looks,
1027      But to his foe supposed he must complain,
1028      And she steal love's sweet bait from fearful hooks:
1029      Being held a foe, he may not have access
1030      To breathe such vows as lovers use to swear;
1031      And she as much in love, her means much less
1032      To meet her new-beloved any where:
1033      But passion lends them power, time means, to meet
1034      Tempering extremities with extreme sweet.
1035      Exit      

1036      SCENE I. A lane by the wall of Capulet's orchard.
1037      Enter ROMEO
1038      ROMEO     
1039      Can I go forward when my heart is here?
1040      Turn back, dull earth, and find thy centre out.
1041      He climbs the wall, and leaps down within it

1042      Enter BENVOLIO and MERCUTIO

1043      BENVOLIO  
1044      Romeo! my cousin Romeo!
1045      MERCUTIO  
1046      He is wise;
1047      And, on my lie, hath stol'n him home to bed.
1048      BENVOLIO  
1049      He ran this way, and leap'd this orchard wall:
1050      Call, good Mercutio.
1051      MERCUTIO  
1052      Nay, I'll conjure too.
1053      Romeo! humours! madman! passion! lover!
1054      Appear thou in the likeness of a sigh:
1055      Speak but one rhyme, and I am satisfied;
1056      Cry but 'Ay me!' pronounce but 'love' and 'dove;'
1057      Speak to my gossip Venus one fair word,
1058      One nick-name for her purblind son and heir,
1059      Young Adam Cupid, he that shot so trim,
1060      When King Cophetua loved the beggar-maid!
1061      He heareth not, he stirreth not, he moveth not;
1062      The ape is dead, and I must conjure him.
1063      I conjure thee by Rosaline's bright eyes,
1064      By her high forehead and her scarlet lip,
1065      By her fine foot, straight leg and quivering thigh
1066      And the demesnes that there adjacent lie,
1067      That in thy likeness thou appear to us!
1068      BENVOLIO  
1069      And if he hear thee, thou wilt anger him.
1070      MERCUTIO  
1071      This cannot anger him: 'twould anger him
1072      To raise a spirit in his mistress' circle
1073      Of some strange nature, letting it there stand
1074      Till she had laid it and conjured it down;
1075      That were some spite: my invocation
1076      Is fair and honest, and in his mistres s' name
1077      I conjure only but to raise up him.
1078      BENVOLIO  
1079      Come, he hath hid himself among these trees,
1080      To be consorted with the humorous night:
1081      Blind is his love and best befits the dark.
1082      MERCUTIO  
1083      If love be blind, love cannot hit the mark.
1084      Now will he sit under a medlar tree,
1085      And wish his mistress were that kind of fruit
1086      As maids call medlars, when they laugh alone.
1087      Romeo, that she were, O, that she were
1088      An open et caetera, thou a poperin pear!
1089      Romeo, good night: I'll to my truckle-bed;
1090      This field-bed is too cold for me to sleep:
1091      Come, shall we go?
1092      BENVOLIO  
1093      Go, then; for 'tis in vain
1094      To seek him here that means not to be found.
1095      Exeunt    

1096      SCENE II. Capulet's orchard.
1097      Enter ROMEO
1098      ROMEO     
1099      He jests at scars that never felt a wound.
1100      JULIET appears above at a window

1101      But, soft! what light through yonder window breaks?
1102      It is the east, and Juliet is the sun.
1103      Arise, fair sun, and kill the envious moon,
1104      Who is already sick and pale with grief,
1105      That thou her maid art far more fair than she:
1106      Be not her maid, since she is envious;
1107      Her vestal livery is but sick and green
1108      And none but fools do wear it; cast it off.
1109      It is my lady, O, it is my love!
1110      O, that she knew she were!
1111      She speaks yet she says nothing: what of that?
1112      Her eye discourses; I will answer it.
1113      I am too bold, 'tis not to me she speaks:
1114      Two of the fairest stars in all the heaven,
1115      Having some business, do entreat her eyes
1116      To twinkle in their spheres till they return.
1117      What if her eyes were there, they in her head?
1118      The brightness of her cheek would shame those stars,
1119      As daylight doth a lamp; her eyes in heaven
1120      Would through the airy region stream so bright
1121      That birds would sing and think it were not night.
1122      See, how she leans her cheek upon her hand!
1123      O, that I were a glove upon that hand,
1124      That I might touch that cheek!
1125      JULIET    
1126      Ay me!    
1127      ROMEO     
1128      She speaks:
1129      O, speak again, bright angel! for thou art
1130      As glorious to this night, being o'er my head
1131      As is a winged messenger of heaven
1132      Unto the white-upturned wondering eyes
1133      Of mortals that fall back to gaze on him
1134      When he bestrides the lazy-pacing clouds
1135      And sails upon the bosom of the air.
1136      JULIET    
1137      O Romeo, Romeo! wherefore art thou Romeo?
1138      Deny thy father and refuse thy name;
1139      Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love,
1140      And I'll no longer be a Capulet.
1141      ROMEO     
1142      [Aside] Shall I hear more, or shall I speak at this?
1143      JULIET    
1144      'Tis but thy name that is my enemy;
1145      Thou art thyself, though not a Montague.
1146      What's Montague? it is nor hand, nor foot,
1147      Nor arm, nor face, nor any other part
1148      Belonging to a man. O, be some other name!
1149      What's in a name? that which we call a rose
1150      By any other name would smell as sweet;
1151      So Romeo would, were he not Romeo call'd,
1152      Retain that dear perfection which he owes
1153      Without that title. Romeo, doff thy name,
1154      And for that name which is no part of thee
1155      Take all myself.
1156      ROMEO     
1157      I take thee at thy word:
1158      Call me but love, and I'll be new baptized;
1159      Henceforth I never will be Romeo.
1160      JULIET    
1161      What man art thou that thus bescreen'd in night
1162      So stumblest on my counsel?
1163      ROMEO     
1164      By a name 
1165      I know not how to tell thee who I am:
1166      My name, dear saint, is hateful to myself,
1167      Because it is an enemy to thee;
1168      Had I it written, I would tear the word.
1169      JULIET    
1170      My ears have not yet drunk a hundred words
1171      Of that tongue's utterance, yet I know the sound:
1172      Art thou not Romeo and a Montague?
1173      ROMEO     
1174      Neither, fair saint, if either thee dislike.
1175      JULIET    
1176      How camest thou hither, tell me, and wherefore?
1177      The orchard walls are high and hard to climb,
1178      And the place death, considering who thou art,
1179      If any of my kinsmen find thee here.
1180      ROMEO     
1181      With love's light wings did I o'er-perch these walls;
1182      For stony limits cannot hold love out,
1183      And what love can do that dares love attempt;
1184      Therefore thy kinsmen are no let to me.
1185      JULIET    
1186      If they do see thee, they will murder thee.
1187      ROMEO     
1188      Alack, there lies more peril in thine eye
1189      Than twenty of their swords: look thou but sweet,
1190      And I am proof against their enmity.
1191      JULIET    
1192      I would not for the world they saw thee here.
1193      ROMEO     
1194      I have night's cloak to hide me from their sight;
1195      And but thou love me, let them find me here:
1196      My life were better ended by their hate,
1197      Than death prorogued, wanting of thy love.
1198      JULIET    
1199      By whose direction found'st thou out this place?
1200      ROMEO     
1201      By love, who first did prompt me to inquire;
1202      He lent me counsel and I lent him eyes.
1203      I am no pilot; yet, wert thou as far
1204      As that vast shore wash'd with the farthest sea,
1205      I would adventure for such merchandise.
1206      JULIET    
1207      Thou know'st the mask of night is on my face,
1208      Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek
1209      For that which thou hast heard me speak to-night
1210      Fain would I dwell on form, fain, fain deny
1211      What I have spoke: but farewell compliment!
1212      Dost thou love me? I know thou wilt say 'Ay,'
1213      And I will take thy word: yet if thou swear'st,
1214      Thou mayst prove false; at lovers' perjuries
1215      Then say, Jove laughs. O gentle Romeo,
1216      If thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully:
1217      Or if thou think'st I am too quickly won,
1218      I'll frown and be perverse an say thee nay,
1219      So thou wilt woo; but else, not for the world.
1220      In truth, fair Montague, I am too fond,
1221      And therefore thou mayst think my 'havior light:
1222      But trust me, gentleman, I'll prove more true
1223      Than those that have more cunning to be strange.
1224      I should have been more strange, I must confess,
1225      But that thou overheard'st, ere I was ware,
1226      My true love's passion: therefore pardon me,
1227      And not impute this yielding to light love,
1228      Which the dark night hath so discovered.
1229      ROMEO     
1230      Lady, by yonder blessed moon I swear
1231      That tips with silver all these fruit-tree tops--
1232      JULIET    
1233      O, swear not by the moon, the inconstant moon,
1234      That monthly changes in her circled orb,
1235      Lest that thy love prove likewise variable.
1236      ROMEO     
1237      What shall I swear by?
1238      JULIET    
1239      Do not swear at all;
1240      Or, if thou wilt, swear by thy gracious self,
1241      Which is the god of my idolatry,
1242      And I'll believe thee.
1243      ROMEO     
1244      If my heart's dear love--
1245      JULIET    
1246      Well, do not swear: although I joy in thee,
1247      I have no joy of this contract to-night:
1248      It is too rash, too unadvised, too sudden;
1249      Too like the lightning, which doth cease to be
1250      Ere one can say 'It lightens.' Sweet, good night!
1251      This bud of love, by summer's ripening breath,
1252      May prove a beauteous flower when next we meet.
1253      Good night, good night! as sweet repose and rest
1254      Come to thy heart as that within my breast!
1255      ROMEO     
1256      O, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?
1257      JULIET    
1258      What satisfaction canst thou have to-night?
1259      ROMEO     
1260      The exchange of thy love's faithful vow for mine.
1261      JULIET    
1262      I gave thee mine before thou didst request it:
1263      And yet I would it were to give again.
1264      ROMEO     
1265      Wouldst thou withdraw it? for what purpose, love?
1266      JULIET    
1267      But to be frank, and give it thee again.
1268      And yet I wish but for the thing I have:
1269      My bounty is as boundless as the sea,
1270      My love as deep; the more I give to thee,
1271      The more I have, for both are infinite.
1272      Nurse calls within

1273      I hear some noise within; dear love, adieu!
1274      Anon, good nurse! Sweet Montague, be true.
1275      Stay but a little, I will come again.
1276      Exit, above

1277      ROMEO     
1278      O blessed, blessed night! I am afeard.
1279      Being in night, all this is but a dream,
1280      Too flattering-sweet to be substantial.
1281      Re-enter JULIET, above

1282      JULIET    
1283      Three words, dear Romeo, and good night indeed.
1284      If that thy bent of love be honourable,
1285      Thy purpose marriage, send me word to-morrow,
1286      By one that I'll procure to come to thee,
1287      Where and what time thou wilt perform the rite;
1288      And all my fortunes at thy foot I'll lay
1289      And follow thee my lord throughout the world.
1290      Nurse     
1291      [Within] Madam!
1292      JULIET    
1293      I come, anon.--But if thou mean'st not well,
1294      I do beseech thee--
1295      Nurse     
1296      [Within] Madam!
1297      JULIET    
1298      By and by, I come:--
1299      To cease thy suit, and leave me to my grief:
1300      To-morrow will I send.
1301      ROMEO     
1302      So thrive my soul--
1303      JULIET    
1304      A thousand times good night!
1305      Exit, above

1306      ROMEO     
1307      A thousand times the worse, to want thy light.
1308      Love goes toward love, as schoolboys from
1309      their books,
1310      But love from love, toward school with heavy looks.
1311      Retiring  

1312      Re-enter JULIET, above

1313      JULIET    
1314      Hist! Romeo, hist! O, for a falconer's voice,
1315      To lure this tassel-gentle back again!
1316      Bondage is hoarse, and may not speak aloud;
1317      Else would I tear the cave where Echo lies,
1318      And make her airy tongue more hoarse than mine,
1319      With repetition of my Romeo's name.
1320      ROMEO     
1321      It is my soul that calls upon my name:
1322      How silver-sweet sound lovers' tongues by night,
1323      Like softest music to attending ears!
1324      JULIET    
1325      Romeo!    
1326      ROMEO     
1327      My dear?  
1328      JULIET    
1329      At what o'clock to-morrow
1330      Shall I send to thee?
1331      ROMEO     
1332      At the hour of nine.
1333      JULIET    
1334      I will not fail: 'tis twenty years till then.
1335      I have forgot why I did call thee back.
1336      ROMEO     
1337      Let me stand here till thou remember it.
1338      JULIET    
1339      I shall forget, to have thee still stand there,
1340      Remembering how I love thy company.
1341      ROMEO     
1342      And I'll still stay, to have thee still forget,
1343      Forgetting any other home but this.
1344      JULIET    
1345      'Tis almost morning; I would have thee gone:
1346      And yet no further than a wanton's bird;
1347      Who lets it hop a little from her hand,
1348      Like a poor prisoner in his twisted gyves,
1349      And with a silk thread plucks it back again,
1350      So loving-jealous of his liberty.
1351      ROMEO     
1352      I would I were thy bird.
1353      JULIET    
1354      Sweet, so would I:
1355      Yet I should kill thee with much cherishing.
1356      Good night, good night! parting is such
1357      sweet sorrow,
1358      That I shall say good night till it be morrow.
1359      Exit above

1360      ROMEO     
1361      Sleep dwell upon thine eyes, peace in thy breast!
1362      Would I were sleep and peace, so sweet to rest!
1363      Hence will I to my ghostly father's cell,
1364      His help to crave, and my dear hap to tell.
1365      Exit      

1366      SCENE III. Friar Laurence's cell.
1367      Enter FRIAR LAURENCE, with a basket
1368      FRIAR LAURENCE
1369      The grey-eyed morn smiles on the frowning night,
1370      Chequering the eastern clouds with streaks of light,
1371      And flecked darkness like a drunkard reels
1372      From forth day's path and Titan's fiery wheels:
1373      Now, ere the sun advance his burning eye,
1374      The day to cheer and night's dank dew to dry,
1375      I must up-fill this osier cage of ours
1376      With baleful weeds and precious-juiced flowers.
1377      The earth that's nature's mother is her tomb;
1378      What is her burying grave that is her womb,
1379      And from her womb children of divers kind
1380      We sucking on her natural bosom find,
1381      Many for many virtues excellent,
1382      None but for some and yet all different.
1383      O, mickle is the powerful grace that lies
1384      In herbs, plants, stones, and their true qualities:
1385      For nought so vile that on the earth doth live
1386      But to the earth some special good doth give,
1387      Nor aught so good but strain'd from that fair use
1388      Revolts from true birth, stumbling on abuse:
1389      Virtue itself turns vice, being misapplied;
1390      And vice sometimes by action dignified.
1391      Within the infant rind of this small flower
1392      Poison hath residence and medicine power:
1393      For this, being smelt, with that part cheers each part;
1394      Being tasted, slays all senses with the heart.
1395      Two such opposed kings encamp them still
1396      In man as well as herbs, grace and rude will;
1397      And where the worser is predominant,
1398      Full soon the canker death eats up that plant.
1399      Enter ROMEO

1400      ROMEO     
1401      Good morrow, father.
1402      FRIAR LAURENCE
1403      Benedicite!
1404      What early tongue so sweet saluteth me?
1405      Young son, it argues a distemper'd head
1406      So soon to bid good morrow to thy bed:
1407      Care keeps his watch in every old man's eye,
1408      And where care lodges, sleep will never lie;
1409      But where unbruised youth with unstuff'd brain
1410      Doth couch his limbs, there golden sleep doth reign:
1411      Therefore thy earliness doth me assure
1412      Thou art up-roused by some distemperature;
1413      Or if not so, then here I hit it right,
1414      Our Romeo hath not been in bed to-night.
1415      ROMEO     
1416      That last is true; the sweeter rest was mine.
1417      FRIAR LAURENCE
1418      God pardon sin! wast thou with Rosaline?
1419      ROMEO     
1420      With Rosaline, my ghostly father? no;
1421      I have forgot that name, and that name's woe.
1422      FRIAR LAURENCE
1423      That's my good son: but where hast thou been, then?
1424      ROMEO     
1425      I'll tell thee, ere thou ask it me again.
1426      I have been feasting with mine enemy,
1427      Where on a sudden one hath wounded me,
1428      That's by me wounded: both our remedies
1429      Within thy help and holy physic lies:
1430      I bear no hatred, blessed man, for, lo,
1431      My intercession likewise steads my foe.
1432      FRIAR LAURENCE
1433      Be plain, good son, and homely in thy drift;
1434      Riddling confession finds but riddling shrift.
1435      ROMEO     
1436      Then plainly know my heart's dear love is set
1437      On the fair daughter of rich Capulet:
1438      As mine on hers, so hers is set on mine;
1439      And all combined, save what thou must combine
1440      By holy marriage: when and where and how
1441      We met, we woo'd and made exchange of vow,
1442      I'll tell thee as we pass; but this I pray,
1443      That thou consent to marry us to-day.
1444      FRIAR LAURENCE
1445      Holy Saint Francis, what a change is here!
1446      Is Rosaline, whom thou didst love so dear,
1447      So soon forsaken? young men's love then lies
1448      Not truly in their hearts, but in their eyes.
1449      Jesu Maria, what a deal of brine
1450      Hath wash'd thy sallow cheeks for Rosaline!
1451      How much salt water thrown away in waste,
1452      To season love, that of it doth not taste!
1453      The sun not yet thy sighs from heaven clears,
1454      Thy old groans ring yet in my ancient ears;
1455      Lo, here upon thy cheek the stain doth sit
1456      Of an old tear that is not wash'd off yet:
1457      If e'er thou wast thyself and these woes thine,
1458      Thou and these woes were all for Rosaline:
1459      And art thou changed? pronounce this sentence then,
1460      Women may fall, when there's no strength in men.
1461      ROMEO     
1462      Thou chid'st me oft for loving Rosaline.
1463      FRIAR LAURENCE
1464      For doting, not for loving, pupil mine.
1465      ROMEO     
1466      And bad'st me bury love.
1467      FRIAR LAURENCE
1468      Not in a grave,
1469      To lay one in, another out to have.
1470      ROMEO     
1471      I pray thee, chide not; she whom I love now
1472      Doth grace for grace and love for love allow;
1473      The other did not so.
1474      FRIAR LAURENCE
1475      O, she knew well
1476      Thy love did read by rote and could not spell.
1477      But come, young waverer, come, go with me,
1478      In one respect I'll thy assistant be;
1479      For this alliance may so happy prove,
1480      To turn your households' rancour to pure love.
1481      ROMEO     
1482      O, let us hence; I stand on sudden haste.
1483      FRIAR LAURENCE
1484      Wisely and slow; they stumble that run fast.
1485      Exeunt    

1486      SCENE IV. A street.
1487      Enter BENVOLIO and MERCUTIO
1488      MERCUTIO  
1489      Where the devil should this Romeo be?
1490      Came he not home to-night?
1491      BENVOLIO  
1492      Not to his father's; I spoke with his man.
1493      MERCUTIO  
1494      Ah, that same pale hard-hearted wench, that Rosaline.
1495      Torments him so, that he will sure run mad.
1496      BENVOLIO  
1497      Tybalt, the kinsman of old Capulet,
1498      Hath sent a letter to his father's house.
1499      MERCUTIO  
1500      A challenge, on my life.
1501      BENVOLIO  
1502      Romeo will answer it.
1503      MERCUTIO  
1504      Any man that can write may answer a letter.
1505      BENVOLIO  
1506      Nay, he will answer the letter's master, how he
1507      dares, being dared.
1508      MERCUTIO  
1509      Alas poor Romeo! he is already dead; stabbed with a
1510      white wench's black eye; shot through the ear with a
1511      love-song; the very pin of his heart cleft with the
1512      blind bow-boy's butt-shaft: and is he a man to
1513      encounter Tybalt?
1514      BENVOLIO  
1515      Why, what is Tybalt?
1516      MERCUTIO  
1517      More than prince of cats, I can tell you. O, he is
1518      the courageous captain of compliments. He fights as
1519      you sing prick-song, keeps time, distance, and
1520      proportion; rests me his minim rest, one, two, and
1521      the third in your bosom: the very butcher of a silk
1522      button, a duellist, a duellist; a gentleman of the
1523      very first house, of the first and second cause:
1524      ah, the immortal passado! the punto reverso! the
1525      hai!      
1526      BENVOLIO  
1527      The what? 
1528      MERCUTIO  
1529      The pox of such antic, lisping, affecting
1530      fantasticoes; these new tuners of accents! 'By Jesu,
1531      a very good blade! a very tall man! a very good
1532      whore!' Why, is not this a lamentable thing,
1533      grandsire, that we should be thus afflicted with
1534      these strange flies, these fashion-mongers, these
1535      perdona-mi's, who stand so much on the new form,
1536      that they cannot at ease on the old bench? O, their
1537      bones, their bones!
1538      Enter ROMEO

1539      BENVOLIO  
1540      Here comes Romeo, here comes Romeo.
1541      MERCUTIO  
1542      Without his roe, like a dried herring: flesh, flesh,
1543      how art thou fishified! Now is he for the numbers
1544      that Petrarch flowed in: Laura to his lady was but a
1545      kitchen-wench; marry, she had a better love to
1546      be-rhyme her; Dido a dowdy; Cleopatra a gipsy;
1547      Helen and Hero hildings and harlots; Thisbe a grey
1548      eye or so, but not to the purpose. Signior
1549      Romeo, bon jour! there's a French salutation
1550      to your French slop. You gave us the counterfeit
1551      fairly last night.
1552      ROMEO     
1553      Good morrow to you both. What counterfeit did I give you?
1554      MERCUTIO  
1555      The ship, sir, the slip; can you not conceive?
1556      ROMEO     
1557      Pardon, good Mercutio, my business was great; and in
1558      such a case as mine a man may strain courtesy.
1559      MERCUTIO  
1560      That's as much as to say, such a case as yours
1561      constrains a man to bow in the hams.
1562      ROMEO     
1563      Meaning, to court'sy.
1564      MERCUTIO  
1565      Thou hast most kindly hit it.
1566      ROMEO     
1567      A most courteous exposition.
1568      MERCUTIO  
1569      Nay, I am the very pink of courtesy.
1570      ROMEO     
1571      Pink for flower.
1572      MERCUTIO  
1573      Right.    
1574      ROMEO     
1575      Why, then is my pump well flowered.
1576      MERCUTIO  
1577      Well said: follow me this jest now till thou hast
1578      worn out thy pump, that when the single sole of it
1579      is worn, the jest may remain after the wearing sole singular.
1580      ROMEO     
1581      O single-soled jest, solely singular for the
1582      singleness.
1583      MERCUTIO  
1584      Come between us, good Benvolio; my wits faint.
1585      ROMEO     
1586      Switch and spurs, switch and spurs; or I'll cry a match.
1587      MERCUTIO  
1588      Nay, if thy wits run the wild-goose chase, I have
1589      done, for thou hast more of the wild-goose in one of
1590      thy wits than, I am sure, I have in my whole five:
1591      was I with you there for the goose?
1592      ROMEO     
1593      Thou wast never with me for any thing when thou wast
1594      not there for the goose.
1595      MERCUTIO  
1596      I will bite thee by the ear for that jest.
1597      ROMEO     
1598      Nay, good goose, bite not.
1599      MERCUTIO  
1600      Thy wit is a very bitter sweeting; it is a most
1601      sharp sauce.
1602      ROMEO     
1603      And is it not well served in to a sweet goose?
1604      MERCUTIO  
1605      O here's a wit of cheveril, that stretches from an
1606      inch narrow to an ell broad!
1607      ROMEO     
1608      I stretch it out for that word 'broad;' which added
1609      to the goose, proves thee far and wide a broad goose.
1610      MERCUTIO  
1611      Why, is not this better now than groaning for love?
1612      now art thou sociable, now art thou Romeo; now art
1613      thou what thou art, by art as well as by nature:
1614      for this drivelling love is like a great natural,
1615      that runs lolling up and down to hide his bauble in a hole.
1616      BENVOLIO  
1617      Stop there, stop there.
1618      MERCUTIO  
1619      Thou desirest me to stop in my tale against the hair.
1620      BENVOLIO  
1621      Thou wouldst else have made thy tale large.
1622      MERCUTIO  
1623      O, thou art deceived; I would have made it short:
1624      for I was come to the whole depth of my tale; and
1625      meant, indeed, to occupy the argument no longer.
1626      ROMEO     
1627      Here's goodly gear!
1628      Enter Nurse and PETER

1629      MERCUTIO  
1630      A sail, a sail!
1631      BENVOLIO  
1632      Two, two; a shirt and a smock.
1633      Nurse     
1634      Peter!    
1635      PETER     
1636      Anon!     
1637      Nurse     
1638      My fan, Peter.
1639      MERCUTIO  
1640      Good Peter, to hide her face; for her fan's the
1641      fairer face.
1642      Nurse     
1643      God ye good morrow, gentlemen.
1644      MERCUTIO  
1645      God ye good den, fair gentlewoman.
1646      Nurse     
1647      Is it good den?
1648      MERCUTIO  
1649      'Tis no less, I tell you, for the bawdy hand of the
1650      dial is now upon the prick of noon.
1651      Nurse     
1652      Out upon you! what a man are you!
1653      ROMEO     
1654      One, gentlewoman, that God hath made for himself to
1655      mar.      
1656      Nurse     
1657      By my troth, it is well said; 'for himself to mar,'
1658      quoth a'? Gentlemen, can any of you tell me where I
1659      may find the young Romeo?
1660      ROMEO     
1661      I can tell you; but young Romeo will be older when
1662      you have found him than he was when you sought him:
1663      I am the youngest of that name, for fault of a worse.
1664      Nurse     
1665      You say well.
1666      MERCUTIO  
1667      Yea, is the worst well? very well took, i' faith;
1668      wisely, wisely.
1669      Nurse     
1670      if you be he, sir, I desire some confidence with
1671      you.      
1672      BENVOLIO  
1673      She will indite him to some supper.
1674      MERCUTIO  
1675      A bawd, a bawd, a bawd! so ho!
1676      ROMEO     
1677      What hast thou found?
1678      MERCUTIO  
1679      No hare, sir; unless a hare, sir, in a lenten pie,
1680      that is something stale and hoar ere it be spent.
1681      Sings     

1682      An old hare hoar,
1683      And an old hare hoar,
1684      Is very good meat in lent
1685      But a hare that is hoar
1686      Is too much for a score,
1687      When it hoars ere it be spent.
1688      Romeo, will you come to your father's? we'll
1689      to dinner, thither.
1690      ROMEO     
1691      I will follow you.
1692      MERCUTIO  
1693      Farewell, ancient lady; farewell,
1694      Singing   

1695      'lady, lady, lady.'
1696      Exeunt MERCUTIO and BENVOLIO

1697      Nurse     
1698      Marry, farewell! I pray you, sir, what saucy
1699      merchant was this, that was so full of his ropery?
1700      ROMEO     
1701      A gentleman, nurse, that loves to hear himself talk,
1702      and will speak more in a minute than he will stand
1703      to in a month.
1704      Nurse     
1705      An a' speak any thing against me, I'll take him
1706      down, an a' were lustier than he is, and twenty such
1707      Jacks; and if I cannot, I'll find those that shall.
1708      Scurvy knave! I am none of his flirt-gills; I am
1709      none of his skains-mates. And thou must stand by
1710      too, and suffer every knave to use me at his pleasure?
1711      PETER     
1712      I saw no man use you a pleasure; if I had, my weapon
1713      should quickly have been out, I warrant you: I dare
1714      draw as soon as another man, if I see occasion in a
1715      good quarrel, and the law on my side.
1716      Nurse     
1717      Now, afore God, I am so vexed, that every part about
1718      me quivers. Scurvy knave! Pray you, sir, a word:
1719      and as I told you, my young lady bade me inquire you
1720      out; what she bade me say, I will keep to myself:
1721      but first let me tell ye, if ye should lead her into
1722      a fool's paradise, as they say, it were a very gross
1723      kind of behavior, as they say: for the gentlewoman
1724      is young; and, therefore, if you should deal double
1725      with her, truly it were an ill thing to be offered
1726      to any gentlewoman, and very weak dealing.
1727      ROMEO     
1728      Nurse, commend me to thy lady and mistress. I
1729      protest unto thee--
1730      Nurse     
1731      Good heart, and, i' faith, I will tell her as much:
1732      Lord, Lord, she will be a joyful woman.
1733      ROMEO     
1734      What wilt thou tell her, nurse? thou dost not mark me.
1735      Nurse     
1736      I will tell her, sir, that you do protest; which, as
1737      I take it, is a gentlemanlike offer.
1738      ROMEO     
1739      Bid her devise
1740      Some means to come to shrift this afternoon;
1741      And there she shall at Friar Laurence' cell
1742      Be shrived and married. Here is for thy pains.
1743      Nurse     
1744      No truly sir; not a penny.
1745      ROMEO     
1746      Go to; I say you shall.
1747      Nurse     
1748      This afternoon, sir? well, she shall be there.
1749      ROMEO     
1750      And stay, good nurse, behind the abbey wall:
1751      Within this hour my man shall be with thee
1752      And bring thee cords made like a tackled stair;
1753      Which to the high top-gallant of my joy
1754      Must be my convoy in the secret night.
1755      Farewell; be trusty, and I'll quit thy pains:
1756      Farewell; commend me to thy mistress.
1757      Nurse     
1758      Now God in heaven bless thee! Hark you, sir.
1759      ROMEO     
1760      What say'st thou, my dear nurse?
1761      Nurse     
1762      Is your man secret? Did you ne'er hear say,
1763      Two may keep counsel, putting one away?
1764      ROMEO     
1765      I warrant thee, my man's as true as steel.
1766      NURSE     
1767      Well, sir; my mistress is the sweetest lady--Lord,
1768      Lord! when 'twas a little prating thing:--O, there
1769      is a nobleman in town, one Paris, that would fain
1770      lay knife aboard; but she, good soul, had as lief
1771      see a toad, a very toad, as see him. I anger her
1772      sometimes and tell her that Paris is the properer
1773      man; but, I'll warrant you, when I say so, she looks
1774      as pale as any clout in the versal world. Doth not
1775      rosemary and Romeo begin both with a letter?
1776      ROMEO     
1777      Ay, nurse; what of that? both with an R.
1778      Nurse     
1779      Ah. mocker! that's the dog's name; R is for
1780      the--No; I know it begins with some other
1781      letter:--and she hath the prettiest sententious of
1782      it, of you and rosemary, that it would do you good
1783      to hear it.
1784      ROMEO     
1785      Commend me to thy lady.
1786      Nurse     
1787      Ay, a thousand times.
1788      Exit Romeo

1789      Peter!    
1790      PETER     
1791      Anon!     
1792      Nurse     
1793      Peter, take my fan, and go before and apace.
1794      Exeunt    

1795      SCENE V. Capulet's orchard.
1796      Enter JULIET
1797      JULIET    
1798      The clock struck nine when I did send the nurse;
1799      In half an hour she promised to return.
1800      Perchance she cannot meet him: that's not so.
1801      O, she is lame! love's heralds should be thoughts,
1802      Which ten times faster glide than the sun's beams,
1803      Driving back shadows over louring hills:
1804      Therefore do nimble-pinion'd doves draw love,
1805      And therefore hath the wind-swift Cupid wings.
1806      Now is the sun upon the highmost hill
1807      Of this day's journey, and from nine till twelve
1808      Is three long hours, yet she is not come.
1809      Had she affections and warm youthful blood,
1810      She would be as swift in motion as a ball;
1811      My words would bandy her to my sweet love,
1812      And his to me:
1813      But old folks, many feign as they were dead;
1814      Unwieldy, slow, heavy and pale as lead.
1815      O God, she comes!
1816      Enter Nurse and PETER

1817      O honey nurse, what news?
1818      Hast thou met with him? Send thy man away.
1819      Nurse     
1820      Peter, stay at the gate.
1821      Exit PETER

1822      JULIET    
1823      Now, good sweet nurse,--O Lord, why look'st thou sad?
1824      Though news be sad, yet tell them merrily;
1825      If good, thou shamest the music of sweet news
1826      By playing it to me with so sour a face.
1827      Nurse     
1828      I am a-weary, give me leave awhile:
1829      Fie, how my bones ache! what a jaunt have I had!
1830      JULIET    
1831      I would thou hadst my bones, and I thy news:
1832      Nay, come, I pray thee, speak; good, good nurse, speak.
1833      Nurse     
1834      Jesu, what haste? can you not stay awhile?
1835      Do you not see that I am out of breath?
1836      JULIET    
1837      How art thou out of breath, when thou hast breath
1838      To say to me that thou art out of breath?
1839      The excuse that thou dost make in this delay
1840      Is longer than the tale thou dost excuse.
1841      Is thy news good, or bad? answer to that;
1842      Say either, and I'll stay the circumstance:
1843      Let me be satisfied, is't good or bad?
1844      Nurse     
1845      Well, you have made a simple choice; you know not
1846      how to choose a man: Romeo! no, not he; though his
1847      face be better than any man's, yet his leg excels
1848      all men's; and for a hand, and a foot, and a body,
1849      though they be not to be talked on, yet they are
1850      past compare: he is not the flower of courtesy,
1851      but, I'll warrant him, as gentle as a lamb. Go thy
1852      ways, wench; serve God. What, have you dined at home?
1853      JULIET    
1854      No, no: but all this did I know before.
1855      What says he of our marriage? what of that?
1856      Nurse     
1857      Lord, how my head aches! what a head have I!
1858      It beats as it would fall in twenty pieces.
1859      My back o' t' other side,--O, my back, my back!
1860      Beshrew your heart for sending me about,
1861      To catch my death with jaunting up and down!
1862      JULIET    
1863      I' faith, I am sorry that thou art not well.
1864      Sweet, sweet, sweet nurse, tell me, what says my love?
1865      Nurse     
1866      Your love says, like an honest gentleman, and a
1867      courteous, and a kind, and a handsome, and, I
1868      warrant, a virtuous,--Where is your mother?
1869      JULIET    
1870      Where is my mother! why, she is within;
1871      Where should she be? How oddly thou repliest!
1872      'Your love says, like an honest gentleman,
1873      Where is your mother?'
1874      Nurse     
1875      O God's lady dear!
1876      Are you so hot? marry, come up, I trow;
1877      Is this the poultice for my aching bones?
1878      Henceforward do your messages yourself.
1879      JULIET    
1880      Here's such a coil! come, what says Romeo?
1881      Nurse     
1882      Have you got leave to go to shrift to-day?
1883      JULIET    
1884      I have.   
1885      Nurse     
1886      Then hie you hence to Friar Laurence' cell;
1887      There stays a husband to make you a wife:
1888      Now comes the wanton blood up in your cheeks,
1889      They'll be in scarlet straight at any news.
1890      Hie you to church; I must another way,
1891      To fetch a ladder, by the which your love
1892      Must climb a bird's nest soon when it is dark:
1893      I am the drudge and toil in your delight,
1894      But you shall bear the burden soon at night.
1895      Go; I'll to dinner: hie you to the cell.
1896      JULIET    
1897      Hie to high fortune! Honest nurse, farewell.
1898      Exeunt    

1899      SCENE VI. Friar Laurence's cell.
1900      Enter FRIAR LAURENCE and ROMEO
1901      FRIAR LAURENCE
1902      So smile the heavens upon this holy act,
1903      That after hours with sorrow chide us not!
1904      ROMEO     
1905      Amen, amen! but come what sorrow can,
1906      It cannot countervail the exchange of joy
1907      That one short minute gives me in her sight:
1908      Do thou but close our hands with holy words,
1909      Then love-devouring death do what he dare;
1910      It is enough I may but call her mine.
1911      FRIAR LAURENCE
1912      These violent delights have violent ends
1913      And in their triumph die, like fire and powder,
1914      Which as they kiss consume: the sweetest honey
1915      Is loathsome in his own deliciousness
1916      And in the taste confounds the appetite:
1917      Therefore love moderately; long love doth so;
1918      Too swift arrives as tardy as too slow.
1919      Enter JULIET

1920      Here comes the lady: O, so light a foot
1921      Will ne'er wear out the everlasting flint:
1922      A lover may bestride the gossamer
1923      That idles in the wanton summer air,
1924      And yet not fall; so light is vanity.
1925      JULIET    
1926      Good even to my ghostly confessor.
1927      FRIAR LAURENCE
1928      Romeo shall thank thee, daughter, for us both.
1929      JULIET    
1930      As much to him, else is his thanks too much.
1931      ROMEO     
1932      Ah, Juliet, if the measure of thy joy
1933      Be heap'd like mine and that thy skill be more
1934      To blazon it, then sweeten with thy breath
1935      This neighbour air, and let rich music's tongue
1936      Unfold the imagined happiness that both
1937      Receive in either by this dear encounter.
1938      JULIET    
1939      Conceit, more rich in matter than in words,
1940      Brags of his substance, not of ornament:
1941      They are but beggars that can count their worth;
1942      But my true love is grown to such excess
1943      I cannot sum up sum of half my wealth.
1944      FRIAR LAURENCE
1945      Come, come with me, and we will make short work;
1946      For, by your leaves, you shall not stay alone
1947      Till holy church incorporate two in one.
1948      Exeunt    

1949      ACT III   
1950      SCENE I. A public place.
1951      Enter MERCUTIO, BENVOLIO, Page, and Servants
1952      BENVOLIO  
1953      I pray thee, good Mercutio, let's retire:
1954      The day is hot, the Capulets abroad,
1955      And, if we meet, we shall not scape a brawl;
1956      For now, these hot days, is the mad blood stirring.
1957      MERCUTIO  
1958      Thou art like one of those fellows that when he
1959      enters the confines of a tavern claps me his sword
1960      upon the table and says 'God send me no need of
1961      thee!' and by the operation of the second cup draws
1962      it on the drawer, when indeed there is no need.
1963      BENVOLIO  
1964      Am I like such a fellow?
1965      MERCUTIO  
1966      Come, come, thou art as hot a Jack in thy mood as
1967      any in Italy, and as soon moved to be moody, and as
1968      soon moody to be moved.
1969      BENVOLIO  
1970      And what to?
1971      MERCUTIO  
1972      Nay, an there were two such, we should have none
1973      shortly, for one would kill the other. Thou! why,
1974      thou wilt quarrel with a man that hath a hair more,
1975      or a hair less, in his beard, than thou hast: thou
1976      wilt quarrel with a man for cracking nuts, having no
1977      other reason but because thou hast hazel eyes: what
1978      eye but such an eye would spy out such a quarrel?
1979      Thy head is as fun of quarrels as an egg is full of
1980      meat, and yet thy head hath been beaten as addle as
1981      an egg for quarrelling: thou hast quarrelled with a
1982      man for coughing in the street, because he hath
1983      wakened thy dog that hath lain asleep in the sun:
1984      didst thou not fall out with a tailor for wearing
1985      his new doublet before Easter? with another, for
1986      tying his new shoes with old riband? and yet thou
1987      wilt tutor me from quarrelling!
1988      BENVOLIO  
1989      An I were so apt to quarrel as thou art, any man
1990      should buy the fee-simple of my life for an hour and a quarter.
1991      MERCUTIO  
1992      The fee-simple! O simple!
1993      BENVOLIO  
1994      By my head, here come the Capulets.
1995      MERCUTIO  
1996      By my heel, I care not.
1997      Enter TYBALT and others

1998      TYBALT    
1999      Follow me close, for I will speak to them.
2000      Gentlemen, good den: a word with one of you.
2001      MERCUTIO  
2002      And but one word with one of us? couple it with
2003      something; make it a word and a blow.
2004      TYBALT    
2005      You shall find me apt enough to that, sir, an you
2006      will give me occasion.
2007      MERCUTIO  
2008      Could you not take some occasion without giving?
2009      TYBALT    
2010      Mercutio, thou consort'st with Romeo,--
2011      MERCUTIO  
2012      Consort! what, dost thou make us minstrels? an
2013      thou make minstrels of us, look to hear nothing but
2014      discords: here's my fiddlestick; here's that shall
2015      make you dance. 'Zounds, consort!
2016      BENVOLIO  
2017      We talk here in the public haunt of men:
2018      Either withdraw unto some private place,
2019      And reason coldly of your grievances,
2020      Or else depart; here all eyes gaze on us.
2021      MERCUTIO  
2022      Men's eyes were made to look, and let them gaze;
2023      I will not budge for no man's pleasure, I.
2024      Enter ROMEO

2025      TYBALT    
2026      Well, peace be with you, sir: here comes my man.
2027      MERCUTIO  
2028      But I'll be hanged, sir, if he wear your livery:
2029      Marry, go before to field, he'll be your follower;
2030      Your worship in that sense may call him 'man.'
2031      TYBALT    
2032      Romeo, the hate I bear thee can afford
2033      No better term than this,--thou art a villain.
2034      ROMEO     
2035      Tybalt, the reason that I have to love thee
2036      Doth much excuse the appertaining rage
2037      To such a greeting: villain am I none;
2038      Therefore farewell; I see thou know'st me not.
2039      TYBALT    
2040      Boy, this shall not excuse the injuries
2041      That thou hast done me; therefore turn and draw.
2042      ROMEO     
2043      I do protest, I never injured thee,
2044      But love thee better than thou canst devise,
2045      Till thou shalt know the reason of my love:
2046      And so, good Capulet,--which name I tender
2047      As dearly as my own,--be satisfied.
2048      MERCUTIO  
2049      O calm, dishonourable, vile submission!
2050      Alla stoccata carries it away.
2051      Draws     

2052      Tybalt, you rat-catcher, will you walk?
2053      TYBALT    
2054      What wouldst thou have with me?
2055      MERCUTIO  
2056      Good king of cats, nothing but one of your nine
2057      lives; that I mean to make bold withal, and as you
2058      shall use me hereafter, drybeat the rest of the
2059      eight. Will you pluck your sword out of his pitcher
2060      by the ears? make haste, lest mine be about your
2061      ears ere it be out.
2062      TYBALT    
2063      I am for you.
2064      Drawing   

2065      ROMEO     
2066      Gentle Mercutio, put thy rapier up.
2067      MERCUTIO  
2068      Come, sir, your passado.
2069      They fight

2070      ROMEO     
2071      Draw, Benvolio; beat down their weapons.
2072      Gentlemen, for shame, forbear this outrage!
2073      Tybalt, Mercutio, the prince expressly hath
2074      Forbidden bandying in Verona streets:
2075      Hold, Tybalt! good Mercutio!
2076      TYBALT under ROMEO's arm stabs MERCUTIO, and flies with his followers

2077      MERCUTIO  
2078      I am hurt.
2079      A plague o' both your houses! I am sped.
2080      Is he gone, and hath nothing?
2081      BENVOLIO  
2082      What, art thou hurt?
2083      MERCUTIO  
2084      Ay, ay, a scratch, a scratch; marry, 'tis enough.
2085      Where is my page? Go, villain, fetch a surgeon.
2086      Exit Page 

2087      ROMEO     
2088      Courage, man; the hurt cannot be much.
2089      MERCUTIO  
2090      No, 'tis not so deep as a well, nor so wide as a
2091      church-door; but 'tis enough,'twill serve: ask for
2092      me to-morrow, and you shall find me a grave man. I
2093      am peppered, I warrant, for this world. A plague o'
2094      both your houses! 'Zounds, a dog, a rat, a mouse, a
2095      cat, to scratch a man to death! a braggart, a
2096      rogue, a villain, that fights by the book of
2097      arithmetic! Why the devil came you between us? I
2098      was hurt under your arm.
2099      ROMEO     
2100      I thought all for the best.
2101      MERCUTIO  
2102      Help me into some house, Benvolio,
2103      Or I shall faint. A plague o' both your houses!
2104      They have made worms' meat of me: I have it,
2105      And soundly too: your houses!
2106      Exeunt MERCUTIO and BENVOLIO

2107      ROMEO     
2108      This gentleman, the prince's near ally,
2109      My very friend, hath got his mortal hurt
2110      In my behalf; my reputation stain'd
2111      With Tybalt's slander,--Tybalt, that an hour
2112      Hath been my kinsman! O sweet Juliet,
2113      Thy beauty hath made me effeminate
2114      And in my temper soften'd valour's steel!
2115      Re-enter BENVOLIO

2116      BENVOLIO  
2117      O Romeo, Romeo, brave Mercutio's dead!
2118      That gallant spirit hath aspired the clouds,
2119      Which too untimely here did scorn the earth.
2120      ROMEO     
2121      This day's black fate on more days doth depend;
2122      This but begins the woe, others must end.
2123      BENVOLIO  
2124      Here comes the furious Tybalt back again.
2125      ROMEO     
2126      Alive, in triumph! and Mercutio slain!
2127      Away to heaven, respective lenity,
2128      And fire-eyed fury be my conduct now!
2129      Re-enter TYBALT

2130      Now, Tybalt, take the villain back again,
2131      That late thou gavest me; for Mercutio's soul
2132      Is but a little way above our heads,
2133      Staying for thine to keep him company:
2134      Either thou, or I, or both, must go with him.
2135      TYBALT    
2136      Thou, wretched boy, that didst consort him here,
2137      Shalt with him hence.
2138      ROMEO     
2139      This shall determine that.
2140      They fight; TYBALT falls

2141      BENVOLIO  
2142      Romeo, away, be gone!
2143      The citizens are up, and Tybalt slain.
2144      Stand not amazed: the prince will doom thee death,
2145      If thou art taken: hence, be gone, away!
2146      ROMEO     
2147      O, I am fortune's fool!
2148      BENVOLIO  
2149      Why dost thou stay?
2150      Exit ROMEO

2151      Enter Citizens, & c

2152      First Citizen
2153      Which way ran he that kill'd Mercutio?
2154      Tybalt, that murderer, which way ran he?
2155      BENVOLIO  
2156      There lies that Tybalt.
2157      First Citizen
2158      Up, sir, go with me;
2159      I charge thee in the princes name, obey.
2160      Enter Prince, attended; MONTAGUE, CAPULET, their Wives, and others

2161      PRINCE    
2162      Where are the vile beginners of this fray?
2163      BENVOLIO  
2164      O noble prince, I can discover all
2165      The unlucky manage of this fatal brawl:
2166      There lies the man, slain by young Romeo,
2167      That slew thy kinsman, brave Mercutio.
2168      LADY CAPULET
2169      Tybalt, my cousin! O my brother's child!
2170      O prince! O cousin! husband! O, the blood is spilt
2171      O my dear kinsman! Prince, as thou art true,
2172      For blood of ours, shed blood of Montague.
2173      O cousin, cousin!
2174      PRINCE    
2175      Benvolio, who began this bloody fray?
2176      BENVOLIO  
2177      Tybalt, here slain, whom Romeo's hand did slay;
2178      Romeo that spoke him fair, bade him bethink
2179      How nice the quarrel was, and urged withal
2180      Your high displeasure: all this uttered
2181      With gentle breath, calm look, knees humbly bow'd,
2182      Could not take truce with the unruly spleen
2183      Of Tybalt deaf to peace, but that he tilts
2184      With piercing steel at bold Mercutio's breast,
2185      Who all as hot, turns deadly point to point,
2186      And, with a martial scorn, with one hand beats
2187      Cold death aside, and with the other sends
2188      It back to Tybalt, whose dexterity,
2189      Retorts it: Romeo he cries aloud,
2190      'Hold, friends! friends, part!' and, swifter than
2191      his tongue,
2192      His agile arm beats down their fatal points,
2193      And 'twixt them rushes; underneath whose arm
2194      An envious thrust from Tybalt hit the life
2195      Of stout Mercutio, and then Tybalt fled;
2196      But by and by comes back to Romeo,
2197      Who had but newly entertain'd revenge,
2198      And to 't they go like lightning, for, ere I
2199      Could draw to part them, was stout Tybalt slain.
2200      And, as he fell, did Romeo turn and fly.
2201      This is the truth, or let Benvolio die.
2202      LADY CAPULET
2203      He is a kinsman to the Montague;
2204      Affection makes him false; he speaks not true:
2205      Some twenty of them fought in this black strife,
2206      And all those twenty could but kill one life.
2207      I beg for justice, which thou, prince, must give;
2208      Romeo slew Tybalt, Romeo must not live.
2209      PRINCE    
2210      Romeo slew him, he slew Mercutio;
2211      Who now the price of his dear blood doth owe?
2212      MONTAGUE  
2213      Not Romeo, prince, he was Mercutio's friend;
2214      His fault concludes but what the law should end,
2215      The life of Tybalt.
2216      PRINCE    
2217      And for that offence
2218      Immediately we do exile him hence:
2219      I have an interest in your hate's proceeding,
2220      My blood for your rude brawls doth lie a-bleeding;
2221      But I'll amerce you with so strong a fine
2222      That you shall all repent the loss of mine:
2223      I will be deaf to pleading and excuses;
2224      Nor tears nor prayers shall purchase out abuses:
2225      Therefore use none: let Romeo hence in haste,
2226      Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.
2227      Bear hence this body and attend our will:
2228      Mercy but murders, pardoning those that kill.
2229      Exeunt    

2230      SCENE II. Capulet's orchard.
2231      Enter JULIET
2232      JULIET    
2233      Gallop apace, you fiery-footed steeds,
2234      Towards Phoebus' lodging: such a wagoner
2235      As Phaethon would whip you to the west,
2236      And bring in cloudy night immediately.
2237      Spread thy close curtain, love-performing night,
2238      That runaway's eyes may wink and Romeo
2239      Leap to these arms, untalk'd of and unseen.
2240      Lovers can see to do their amorous rites
2241      By their own beauties; or, if love be blind,
2242      It best agrees with night. Come, civil night,
2243      Thou sober-suited matron, all in black,
2244      And learn me how to lose a winning match,
2245      Play'd for a pair of stainless maidenhoods:
2246      Hood my unmann'd blood, bating in my cheeks,
2247      With thy black mantle; till strange love, grown bold,
2248      Think true love acted simple modesty.
2249      Come, night; come, Romeo; come, thou day in night;
2250      For thou wilt lie upon the wings of night
2251      Whiter than new snow on a raven's back.
2252      Come, gentle night, come, loving, black-brow'd night,
2253      Give me my Romeo; and, when he shall die,
2254      Take him and cut him out in little stars,
2255      And he will make the face of heaven so fine
2256      That all the world will be in love with night
2257      And pay no worship to the garish sun.
2258      O, I have bought the mansion of a love,
2259      But not possess'd it, and, though I am sold,
2260      Not yet enjoy'd: so tedious is this day
2261      As is the night before some festival
2262      To an impatient child that hath new robes
2263      And may not wear them. O, here comes my nurse,
2264      And she brings news; and every tongue that speaks
2265      But Romeo's name speaks heavenly eloquence.
2266      Enter Nurse, with cords

2267      Now, nurse, what news? What hast thou there? the cords
2268      That Romeo bid thee fetch?
2269      Nurse     
2270      Ay, ay, the cords.
2271      Throws them down

2272      JULIET    
2273      Ay me! what news? why dost thou wring thy hands?
2274      Nurse     
2275      Ah, well-a-day! he's dead, he's dead, he's dead!
2276      We are undone, lady, we are undone!
2277      Alack the day! he's gone, he's kill'd, he's dead!
2278      JULIET    
2279      Can heaven be so envious?
2280      Nurse     
2281      Romeo can,
2282      Though heaven cannot: O Romeo, Romeo!
2283      Who ever would have thought it? Romeo!
2284      JULIET    
2285      What devil art thou, that dost torment me thus?
2286      This torture should be roar'd in dismal hell.
2287      Hath Romeo slain himself? say thou but 'I,'
2288      And that bare vowel 'I' shall poison more
2289      Than the death-darting eye of cockatrice:
2290      I am not I, if there be such an I;
2291      Or those eyes shut, that make thee answer 'I.'
2292      If he be slain, say 'I'; or if not, no:
2293      Brief sounds determine of my weal or woe.
2294      Nurse     
2295      I saw the wound, I saw it with mine eyes,--
2296      God save the mark!--here on his manly breast:
2297      A piteous corse, a bloody piteous corse;
2298      Pale, pale as ashes, all bedaub'd in blood,
2299      All in gore-blood; I swounded at the sight.
2300      JULIET    
2301      O, break, my heart! poor bankrupt, break at once!
2302      To prison, eyes, ne'er look on liberty!
2303      Vile earth, to earth resign; end motion here;
2304      And thou and Romeo press one heavy bier!
2305      Nurse     
2306      O Tybalt, Tybalt, the best friend I had!
2307      O courteous Tybalt! honest gentleman!
2308      That ever I should live to see thee dead!
2309      JULIET    
2310      What storm is this that blows so contrary?
2311      Is Romeo slaughter'd, and is Tybalt dead?
2312      My dear-loved cousin, and my dearer lord?
2313      Then, dreadful trumpet, sound the general doom!
2314      For who is living, if those two are gone?
2315      Nurse     
2316      Tybalt is gone, and Romeo banished;
2317      Romeo that kill'd him, he is banished.
2318      JULIET    
2319      O God! did Romeo's hand shed Tybalt's blood?
2320      Nurse     
2321      It did, it did; alas the day, it did!
2322      JULIET    
2323      O serpent heart, hid with a flowering face!
2324      Did ever dragon keep so fair a cave?
2325      Beautiful tyrant! fiend angelical!
2326      Dove-feather'd raven! wolvish-ravening lamb!
2327      Despised substance of divinest show!
2328      Just opposite to what thou justly seem'st,
2329      A damned saint, an honourable villain!
2330      O nature, what hadst thou to do in hell,
2331      When thou didst bower the spirit of a fiend
2332      In moral paradise of such sweet flesh?
2333      Was ever book containing such vile matter
2334      So fairly bound? O that deceit should dwell
2335      In such a gorgeous palace!
2336      Nurse     
2337      There's no trust,
2338      No faith, no honesty in men; all perjured,
2339      All forsworn, all naught, all dissemblers.
2340      Ah, where's my man? give me some aqua vitae:
2341      These griefs, these woes, these sorrows make me old.
2342      Shame come to Romeo!
2343      JULIET    
2344      Blister'd be thy tongue
2345      For such a wish! he was not born to shame:
2346      Upon his brow shame is ashamed to sit;
2347      For 'tis a throne where honour may be crown'd
2348      Sole monarch of the universal earth.
2349      O, what a beast was I to chide at him!
2350      Nurse     
2351      Will you speak well of him that kill'd your cousin?
2352      JULIET    
2353      Shall I speak ill of him that is my husband?
2354      Ah, poor my lord, what tongue shall smooth thy name,
2355      When I, thy three-hours wife, have mangled it?
2356      But, wherefore, villain, didst thou kill my cousin?
2357      That villain cousin would have kill'd my husband:
2358      Back, foolish tears, back to your native spring;
2359      Your tributary drops belong to woe,
2360      Which you, mistaking, offer up to joy.
2361      My husband lives, that Tybalt would have slain;
2362      And Tybalt's dead, that would have slain my husband:
2363      All this is comfort; wherefore weep I then?
2364      Some word there was, worser than Tybalt's death,
2365      That murder'd me: I would forget it fain;
2366      But, O, it presses to my memory,
2367      Like damned guilty deeds to sinners' minds:
2368      'Tybalt is dead, and Romeo--banished;'
2369      That 'banished,' that one word 'banished,'
2370      Hath slain ten thousand Tybalts. Tybalt's death
2371      Was woe enough, if it had ended there:
2372      Or, if sour woe delights in fellowship
2373      And needly will be rank'd with other griefs,
2374      Why follow'd not, when she said 'Tybalt's dead,'
2375      Thy father, or thy mother, nay, or both,
2376      Which modern lamentations might have moved?
2377      But with a rear-ward following Tybalt's death,
2378      'Romeo is banished,' to speak that word,
2379      Is father, mother, Tybalt, Romeo, Juliet,
2380      All slain, all dead. 'Romeo is banished!'
2381      There is no end, no limit, measure, bound,
2382      In that word's death; no words can that woe sound.
2383      Where is my father, and my mother, nurse?
2384      Nurse     
2385      Weeping and wailing over Tybalt's corse:
2386      Will you go to them? I will bring you thither.
2387      JULIET    
2388      Wash they his wounds with tears: mine shall be spent,
2389      When theirs are dry, for Romeo's banishment.
2390      Take up those cords: poor ropes, you are beguiled,
2391      Both you and I; for Romeo is exiled:
2392      He made you for a highway to my bed;
2393      But I, a maid, die maiden-widowed.
2394      Come, cords, come, nurse; I'll to my wedding-bed;
2395      And death, not Romeo, take my maidenhead!
2396      Nurse     
2397      Hie to your chamber: I'll find Romeo
2398      To comfort you: I wot well where he is.
2399      Hark ye, your Romeo will be here at night:
2400      I'll to him; he is hid at Laurence' cell.
2401      JULIET    
2402      O, find him! give this ring to my true knight,
2403      And bid him come to take his last farewell.
2404      Exeunt    

2405      SCENE III. Friar Laurence's cell.
2406      Enter FRIAR LAURENCE
2407      FRIAR LAURENCE
2408      Romeo, come forth; come forth, thou fearful man:
2409      Affliction is enamour'd of thy parts,
2410      And thou art wedded to calamity.
2411      Enter ROMEO

2412      ROMEO     
2413      Father, what news? what is the prince's doom?
2414      What sorrow craves acquaintance at my hand,
2415      That I yet know not?
2416      FRIAR LAURENCE
2417      Too familiar
2418      Is my dear son with such sour company:
2419      I bring thee tidings of the prince's doom.
2420      ROMEO     
2421      What less than dooms-day is the prince's doom?
2422      FRIAR LAURENCE
2423      A gentler judgment vanish'd from his lips,
2424      Not body's death, but body's banishment.
2425      ROMEO     
2426      Ha, banishment! be merciful, say 'death;'
2427      For exile hath more terror in his look,
2428      Much more than death: do not say 'banishment.'
2429      FRIAR LAURENCE
2430      Hence from Verona art thou banished:
2431      Be patient, for the world is broad and wide.
2432      ROMEO     
2433      There is no world without Verona walls,
2434      But purgatory, torture, hell itself.
2435      Hence-banished is banish'd from the world,
2436      And world's exile is death: then banished,
2437      Is death mis-term'd: calling death banishment,
2438      Thou cutt'st my head off with a golden axe,
2439      And smilest upon the stroke that murders me.
2440      FRIAR LAURENCE
2441      O deadly sin! O rude unthankfulness!
2442      Thy fault our law calls death; but the kind prince,
2443      Taking thy part, hath rush'd aside the law,
2444      And turn'd that black word death to banishment:
2445      This is dear mercy, and thou seest it not.
2446      ROMEO     
2447      'Tis torture, and not mercy: heaven is here,
2448      Where Juliet lives; and every cat and dog
2449      And little mouse, every unworthy thing,
2450      Live here in heaven and may look on her;
2451      But Romeo may not: more validity,
2452      More honourable state, more courtship lives
2453      In carrion-flies than Romeo: they my seize
2454      On the white wonder of dear Juliet's hand
2455      And steal immortal blessing from her lips,
2456      Who even in pure and vestal modesty,
2457      Still blush, as thinking their own kisses sin;
2458      But Romeo may not; he is banished:
2459      Flies may do this, but I from this must fly:
2460      They are free men, but I am banished.
2461      And say'st thou yet that exile is not death?
2462      Hadst thou no poison mix'd, no sharp-ground knife,
2463      No sudden mean of death, though ne'er so mean,
2464      But 'banished' to kill me?--'banished'?
2465      O friar, the damned use that word in hell;
2466      Howlings attend it: how hast thou the heart,
2467      Being a divine, a ghostly confessor,
2468      A sin-absolver, and my friend profess'd,
2469      To mangle me with that word 'banished'?
2470      FRIAR LAURENCE
2471      Thou fond mad man, hear me but speak a word.
2472      ROMEO     
2473      O, thou wilt speak again of banishment.
2474      FRIAR LAURENCE
2475      I'll give thee armour to keep off that word:
2476      Adversity's sweet milk, philosophy,
2477      To comfort thee, though thou art banished.
2478      ROMEO     
2479      Yet 'banished'? Hang up philosophy!
2480      Unless philosophy can make a Juliet,
2481      Displant a town, reverse a prince's doom,
2482      It helps not, it prevails not: talk no more.
2483      FRIAR LAURENCE
2484      O, then I see that madmen have no ears.
2485      ROMEO     
2486      How should they, when that wise men have no eyes?
2487      FRIAR LAURENCE
2488      Let me dispute with thee of thy estate.
2489      ROMEO     
2490      Thou canst not speak of that thou dost not feel:
2491      Wert thou as young as I, Juliet thy love,
2492      An hour but married, Tybalt murdered,
2493      Doting like me and like me banished,
2494      Then mightst thou speak, then mightst thou tear thy hair,
2495      And fall upon the ground, as I do now,
2496      Taking the measure of an unmade grave.
2497      Knocking within

2498      FRIAR LAURENCE
2499      Arise; one knocks; good Romeo, hide thyself.
2500      ROMEO     
2501      Not I; unless the breath of heartsick groans,
2502      Mist-like, infold me from the search of eyes.
2503      Knocking  

2504      FRIAR LAURENCE
2505      Hark, how they knock! Who's there? Romeo, arise;
2506      Thou wilt be taken. Stay awhile! Stand up;
2507      Knocking  

2508      Run to my study. By and by! God's will,
2509      What simpleness is this! I come, I come!
2510      Knocking  

2511      Who knocks so hard? whence come you? what's your will?
2512      Nurse     
2513      [Within] Let me come in, and you shall know
2514      my errand;
2515      I come from Lady Juliet.
2516      FRIAR LAURENCE
2517      Welcome, then.
2518      Enter Nurse

2519      Nurse     
2520      O holy friar, O, tell me, holy friar,
2521      Where is my lady's lord, where's Romeo?
2522      FRIAR LAURENCE
2523      There on the ground, with his own tears made drunk.
2524      Nurse     
2525      O, he is even in my mistress' case,
2526      Just in her case! O woful sympathy!
2527      Piteous predicament! Even so lies she,
2528      Blubbering and weeping, weeping and blubbering.
2529      Stand up, stand up; stand, and you be a man:
2530      For Juliet's sake, for her sake, rise and stand;
2531      Why should you fall into so deep an O?
2532      ROMEO     
2533      Nurse!    
2534      Nurse     
2535      Ah sir! ah sir! Well, death's the end of all.
2536      ROMEO     
2537      Spakest thou of Juliet? how is it with her?
2538      Doth she not think me an old murderer,
2539      Now I have stain'd the childhood of our joy
2540      With blood removed but little from her own?
2541      Where is she? and how doth she? and what says
2542      My conceal'd lady to our cancell'd love?
2543      Nurse     
2544      O, she says nothing, sir, but weeps and weeps;
2545      And now falls on her bed; and then starts up,
2546      And Tybalt calls; and then on Romeo cries,
2547      And then down falls again.
2548      ROMEO     
2549      As if that name,
2550      Shot from the deadly level of a gun,
2551      Did murder her; as that name's cursed hand
2552      Murder'd her kinsman. O, tell me, friar, tell me,
2553      In what vile part of this anatomy
2554      Doth my name lodge? tell me, that I may sack
2555      The hateful mansion.
2556      Drawing his sword

2557      FRIAR LAURENCE
2558      Hold thy desperate hand:
2559      Art thou a man? thy form cries out thou art:
2560      Thy tears are womanish; thy wild acts denote
2561      The unreasonable fury of a beast:
2562      Unseemly woman in a seeming man!
2563      Or ill-beseeming beast in seeming both!
2564      Thou hast amazed me: by my holy order,
2565      I thought thy disposition better temper'd.
2566      Hast thou slain Tybalt? wilt thou slay thyself?
2567      And stay thy lady too that lives in thee,
2568      By doing damned hate upon thyself?
2569      Why rail'st thou on thy birth, the heaven, and earth?
2570      Since birth, and heaven, and earth, all three do meet
2571      In thee at once; which thou at once wouldst lose.
2572      Fie, fie, thou shamest thy shape, thy love, thy wit;
2573      Which, like a usurer, abound'st in all,
2574      And usest none in that true use indeed
2575      Which should bedeck thy shape, thy love, thy wit:
2576      Thy noble shape is but a form of wax,
2577      Digressing from the valour of a man;
2578      Thy dear love sworn but hollow perjury,
2579      Killing that love which thou hast vow'd to cherish;
2580      Thy wit, that ornament to shape and love,
2581      Misshapen in the conduct of them both,
2582      Like powder in a skitless soldier's flask,
2583      Is set afire by thine own ignorance,
2584      And thou dismember'd with thine own defence.
2585      What, rouse thee, man! thy Juliet is alive,
2586      For whose dear sake thou wast but lately dead;
2587      There art thou happy: Tybalt would kill thee,
2588      But thou slew'st Tybalt; there are thou happy too:
2589      The law that threaten'd death becomes thy friend
2590      And turns it to exile; there art thou happy:
2591      A pack of blessings lights up upon thy back;
2592      Happiness courts thee in her best array;
2593      But, like a misbehaved and sullen wench,
2594      Thou pout'st upon thy fortune and thy love:
2595      Take heed, take heed, for such die miserable.
2596      Go, get thee to thy love, as was decreed,
2597      Ascend her chamber, hence and comfort her:
2598      But look thou stay not till the watch be set,
2599      For then thou canst not pass to Mantua;
2600      Where thou shalt live, till we can find a time
2601      To blaze your marriage, reconcile your friends,
2602      Beg pardon of the prince, and call thee back
2603      With twenty hundred thousand times more joy
2604      Than thou went'st forth in lamentation.
2605      Go before, nurse: commend me to thy lady;
2606      And bid her hasten all the house to bed,
2607      Which heavy sorrow makes them apt unto:
2608      Romeo is coming.
2609      Nurse     
2610      O Lord, I could have stay'd here all the night
2611      To hear good counsel: O, what learning is!
2612      My lord, I'll tell my lady you will come.
2613      ROMEO     
2614      Do so, and bid my sweet prepare to chide.
2615      Nurse     
2616      Here, sir, a ring she bid me give you, sir:
2617      Hie you, make haste, for it grows very late.
2618      Exit      

2619      ROMEO     
2620      How well my comfort is revived by this!
2621      FRIAR LAURENCE
2622      Go hence; good night; and here stands all your state:
2623      Either be gone before the watch be set,
2624      Or by the break of day disguised from hence:
2625      Sojourn in Mantua; I'll find out your man,
2626      And he shall signify from time to time
2627      Every good hap to you that chances here:
2628      Give me thy hand; 'tis late: farewell; good night.
2629      ROMEO     
2630      But that a joy past joy calls out on me,
2631      It were a grief, so brief to part with thee: Farewell.
2632      Exeunt    

2633      SCENE IV. A room in Capulet's house.
2634      Enter CAPULET, LADY CAPULET, and PARIS
2635      CAPULET   
2636      Things have fall'n out, sir, so unluckily,
2637      That we have had no time to move our daughter:
2638      Look you, she loved her kinsman Tybalt dearly,
2639      And so did I:--Well, we were born to die.
2640      'Tis very late, she'll not come down to-night:
2641      I promise you, but for your company,
2642      I would have been a-bed an hour ago.
2643      PARIS     
2644      These times of woe afford no time to woo.
2645      Madam, good night: commend me to your daughter.
2646      LADY CAPULET
2647      I will, and know her mind early to-morrow;
2648      To-night she is mew'd up to her heaviness.
2649      CAPULET   
2650      Sir Paris, I will make a desperate tender
2651      Of my child's love: I think she will be ruled
2652      In all respects by me; nay, more, I doubt it not.
2653      Wife, go you to her ere you go to bed;
2654      Acquaint her here of my son Paris' love;
2655      And bid her, mark you me, on Wednesday next--
2656      But, soft! what day is this?
2657      PARIS     
2658      Monday, my lord,
2659      CAPULET   
2660      Monday! ha, ha! Well, Wednesday is too soon,
2661      O' Thursday let it be: o' Thursday, tell her,
2662      She shall be married to this noble earl.
2663      Will you be ready? do you like this haste?
2664      We'll keep no great ado,--a friend or two;
2665      For, hark you, Tybalt being slain so late,
2666      It may be thought we held him carelessly,
2667      Being our kinsman, if we revel much:
2668      Therefore we'll have some half a dozen friends,
2669      And there an end. But what say you to Thursday?
2670      PARIS     
2671      My lord, I would that Thursday were to-morrow.
2672      CAPULET   
2673      Well get you gone: o' Thursday be it, then.
2674      Go you to Juliet ere you go to bed,
2675      Prepare her, wife, against this wedding-day.
2676      Farewell, my lord. Light to my chamber, ho!
2677      Afore me! it is so very very late,
2678      That we may call it early by and by.
2679      Good night.
2680      Exeunt    

2681      SCENE V. Capulet's orchard.
2682      Enter ROMEO and JULIET above, at the window
2683      JULIET    
2684      Wilt thou be gone? it is not yet near day:
2685      It was the nightingale, and not the lark,
2686      That pierced the fearful hollow of thine ear;
2687      Nightly she sings on yon pomegranate-tree:
2688      Believe me, love, it was the nightingale.
2689      ROMEO     
2690      It was the lark, the herald of the morn,
2691      No nightingale: look, love, what envious streaks
2692      Do lace the severing clouds in yonder east:
2693      Night's candles are burnt out, and jocund day
2694      Stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops.
2695      I must be gone and live, or stay and die.
2696      JULIET    
2697      Yon light is not day-light, I know it, I:
2698      It is some meteor that the sun exhales,
2699      To be to thee this night a torch-bearer,
2700      And light thee on thy way to Mantua:
2701      Therefore stay yet; thou need'st not to be gone.
2702      ROMEO     
2703      Let me be ta'en, let me be put to death;
2704      I am content, so thou wilt have it so.
2705      I'll say yon grey is not the morning's eye,
2706      'Tis but the pale reflex of Cynthia's brow;
2707      Nor that is not the lark, whose notes do beat
2708      The vaulty heaven so high above our heads:
2709      I have more care to stay than will to go:
2710      Come, death, and welcome! Juliet wills it so.
2711      How is't, my soul? let's talk; it is not day.
2712      JULIET    
2713      It is, it is: hie hence, be gone, away!
2714      It is the lark that sings so out of tune,
2715      Straining harsh discords and unpleasing sharps.
2716      Some say the lark makes sweet division;
2717      This doth not so, for she divideth us:
2718      Some say the lark and loathed toad change eyes,
2719      O, now I would they had changed voices too!
2720      Since arm from arm that voice doth us affray,
2721      Hunting thee hence with hunt's-up to the day,
2722      O, now be gone; more light and light it grows.
2723      ROMEO     
2724      More light and light; more dark and dark our woes!
2725      Enter Nurse, to the chamber

2726      Nurse     
2727      Madam!    
2728      JULIET    
2729      Nurse?    
2730      Nurse     
2731      Your lady mother is coming to your chamber:
2732      The day is broke; be wary, look about.
2733      Exit      

2734      JULIET    
2735      Then, window, let day in, and let life out.
2736      ROMEO     
2737      Farewell, farewell! one kiss, and I'll descend.
2738      He goeth down

2739      JULIET    
2740      Art thou gone so? love, lord, ay, husband, friend!
2741      I must hear from thee every day in the hour,
2742      For in a minute there are many days:
2743      O, by this count I shall be much in years
2744      Ere I again behold my Romeo!
2745      ROMEO     
2746      Farewell! 
2747      I will omit no opportunity
2748      That may convey my greetings, love, to thee.
2749      JULIET    
2750      O think'st thou we shall ever meet again?
2751      ROMEO     
2752      I doubt it not; and all these woes shall serve
2753      For sweet discourses in our time to come.
2754      JULIET    
2755      O God, I have an ill-divining soul!
2756      Methinks I see thee, now thou art below,
2757      As one dead in the bottom of a tomb:
2758      Either my eyesight fails, or thou look'st pale.
2759      ROMEO     
2760      And trust me, love, in my eye so do you:
2761      Dry sorrow drinks our blood. Adieu, adieu!
2762      Exit      

2763      JULIET    
2764      O fortune, fortune! all men call thee fickle:
2765      If thou art fickle, what dost thou with him.
2766      That is renown'd for faith? Be fickle, fortune;
2767      For then, I hope, thou wilt not keep him long,
2768      But send him back.
2769      LADY CAPULET
2770      [Within] Ho, daughter! are you up?
2771      JULIET    
2772      Who is't that calls? is it my lady mother?
2773      Is she not down so late, or up so early?
2774      What unaccustom'd cause procures her hither?
2775      Enter LADY CAPULET

2776      LADY CAPULET
2777      Why, how now, Juliet!
2778      JULIET    
2779      Madam, I am not well.
2780      LADY CAPULET
2781      Evermore weeping for your cousin's death?
2782      What, wilt thou wash him from his grave with tears?
2783      An if thou couldst, thou couldst not make him live;
2784      Therefore, have done: some grief shows much of love;
2785      But much of grief shows still some want of wit.
2786      JULIET    
2787      Yet let me weep for such a feeling loss.
2788      LADY CAPULET
2789      So shall you feel the loss, but not the friend
2790      Which you weep for.
2791      JULIET    
2792      Feeling so the loss,
2793      Cannot choose but ever weep the friend.
2794      LADY CAPULET
2795      Well, girl, thou weep'st not so much for his death,
2796      As that the villain lives which slaughter'd him.
2797      JULIET    
2798      What villain madam?
2799      LADY CAPULET
2800      That same villain, Romeo.
2801      JULIET    
2802      [Aside] Villain and he be many miles asunder.--
2803      God Pardon him! I do, with all my heart;
2804      And yet no man like he doth grieve my heart.
2805      LADY CAPULET
2806      That is, because the traitor murderer lives.
2807      JULIET    
2808      Ay, madam, from the reach of these my hands:
2809      Would none but I might venge my cousin's death!
2810      LADY CAPULET
2811      We will have vengeance for it, fear thou not:
2812      Then weep no more. I'll send to one in Mantua,
2813      Where that same banish'd runagate doth live,
2814      Shall give him such an unaccustom'd dram,
2815      That he shall soon keep Tybalt company:
2816      And then, I hope, thou wilt be satisfied.
2817      JULIET    
2818      Indeed, I never shall be satisfied
2819      With Romeo, till I behold him--dead--
2820      Is my poor heart for a kinsman vex'd.
2821      Madam, if you could find out but a man
2822      To bear a poison, I would temper it;
2823      That Romeo should, upon receipt thereof,
2824      Soon sleep in quiet. O, how my heart abhors
2825      To hear him named, and cannot come to him.
2826      To wreak the love I bore my cousin
2827      Upon his body that slaughter'd him!
2828      LADY CAPULET
2829      Find thou the means, and I'll find such a man.
2830      But now I'll tell thee joyful tidings, girl.
2831      JULIET    
2832      And joy comes well in such a needy time:
2833      What are they, I beseech your ladyship?
2834      LADY CAPULET
2835      Well, well, thou hast a careful father, child;
2836      One who, to put thee from thy heaviness,
2837      Hath sorted out a sudden day of joy,
2838      That thou expect'st not nor I look'd not for.
2839      JULIET    
2840      Madam, in happy time, what day is that?
2841      LADY CAPULET
2842      Marry, my child, early next Thursday morn,
2843      The gallant, young and noble gentleman,
2844      The County Paris, at Saint Peter's Church,
2845      Shall happily make thee there a joyful bride.
2846      JULIET    
2847      Now, by Saint Peter's Church and Peter too,
2848      He shall not make me there a joyful bride.
2849      I wonder at this haste; that I must wed
2850      Ere he, that should be husband, comes to woo.
2851      I pray you, tell my lord and father, madam,
2852      I will not marry yet; and, when I do, I swear,
2853      It shall be Romeo, whom you know I hate,
2854      Rather than Paris. These are news indeed!
2855      LADY CAPULET
2856      Here comes your father; tell him so yourself,
2857      And see how he will take it at your hands.
2858      Enter CAPULET and Nurse

2859      CAPULET   
2860      When the sun sets, the air doth drizzle dew;
2861      But for the sunset of my brother's son
2862      It rains downright.
2863      How now! a conduit, girl? what, still in tears?
2864      Evermore showering? In one little body
2865      Thou counterfeit'st a bark, a sea, a wind;
2866      For still thy eyes, which I may call the sea,
2867      Do ebb and flow with tears; the bark thy body is,
2868      Sailing in this salt flood; the winds, thy sighs;
2869      Who, raging with thy tears, and they with them,
2870      Without a sudden calm, will overset
2871      Thy tempest-tossed body. How now, wife!
2872      Have you deliver'd to her our decree?
2873      LADY CAPULET
2874      Ay, sir; but she will none, she gives you thanks.
2875      I would the fool were married to her grave!
2876      CAPULET   
2877      Soft! take me with you, take me with you, wife.
2878      How! will she none? doth she not give us thanks?
2879      Is she not proud? doth she not count her blest,
2880      Unworthy as she is, that we have wrought
2881      So worthy a gentleman to be her bridegroom?
2882      JULIET    
2883      Not proud, you have; but thankful, that you have:
2884      Proud can I never be of what I hate;
2885      But thankful even for hate, that is meant love.
2886      CAPULET   
2887      How now, how now, chop-logic! What is this?
2888      'Proud,' and 'I thank you,' and 'I thank you not;'
2889      And yet 'not proud,' mistress minion, you,
2890      Thank me no thankings, nor, proud me no prouds,
2891      But fettle your fine joints 'gainst Thursday next,
2892      To go with Paris to Saint Peter's Church,
2893      Or I will drag thee on a hurdle thither.
2894      Out, you green-sickness carrion! out, you baggage!
2895      You tallow-face!
2896      LADY CAPULET
2897      Fie, fie! what, are you mad?
2898      JULIET    
2899      Good father, I beseech you on my knees,
2900      Hear me with patience but to speak a word.
2901      CAPULET   
2902      Hang thee, young baggage! disobedient wretch!
2903      I tell thee what: get thee to church o' Thursday,
2904      Or never after look me in the face:
2905      Speak not, reply not, do not answer me;
2906      My fingers itch. Wife, we scarce thought us blest
2907      That God had lent us but this only child;
2908      But now I see this one is one too much,
2909      And that we have a curse in having her:
2910      Out on her, hilding!
2911      Nurse     
2912      God in heaven bless her!
2913      You are to blame, my lord, to rate her so.
2914      CAPULET   
2915      And why, my lady wisdom? hold your tongue,
2916      Good prudence; smatter with your gossips, go.
2917      Nurse     
2918      I speak no treason.
2919      CAPULET   
2920      O, God ye god-den.
2921      Nurse     
2922      May not one speak?
2923      CAPULET   
2924      Peace, you mumbling fool!
2925      Utter your gravity o'er a gossip's bowl;
2926      For here we need it not.
2927      LADY CAPULET
2928      You are too hot.
2929      CAPULET   
2930      God's bread! it makes me mad:
2931      Day, night, hour, tide, time, work, play,
2932      Alone, in company, still my care hath been
2933      To have her match'd: and having now provided
2934      A gentleman of noble parentage,
2935      Of fair demesnes, youthful, and nobly train'd,
2936      Stuff'd, as they say, with honourable parts,
2937      Proportion'd as one's thought would wish a man;
2938      And then to have a wretched puling fool,
2939      A whining mammet, in her fortune's tender,
2940      To answer 'I'll not wed; I cannot love,
2941      I am too young; I pray you, pardon me.'
2942      But, as you will not wed, I'll pardon you:
2943      Graze where you will you shall not house with me:
2944      Look to't, think on't, I do not use to jest.
2945      Thursday is near; lay hand on heart, advise:
2946      An you be mine, I'll give you to my friend;
2947      And you be not, hang, beg, starve, die in
2948      the streets,
2949      For, by my soul, I'll ne'er acknowledge thee,
2950      Nor what is mine shall never do thee good:
2951      Trust to't, bethink you; I'll not be forsworn.
2952      Exit      

2953      JULIET    
2954      Is there no pity sitting in the clouds,
2955      That sees into the bottom of my grief?
2956      O, sweet my mother, cast me not away!
2957      Delay this marriage for a month, a week;
2958      Or, if you do not, make the bridal bed
2959      In that dim monument where Tybalt lies.
2960      LADY CAPULET
2961      Talk not to me, for I'll not speak a word:
2962      Do as thou wilt, for I have done with thee.
2963      Exit      

2964      JULIET    
2965      O God!--O nurse, how shall this be prevented?
2966      My husband is on earth, my faith in heaven;
2967      How shall that faith return again to earth,
2968      Unless that husband send it me from heaven
2969      By leaving earth? comfort me, counsel me.
2970      Alack, alack, that heaven should practise stratagems
2971      Upon so soft a subject as myself!
2972      What say'st thou? hast thou not a word of joy?
2973      Some comfort, nurse.
2974      Nurse     
2975      Faith, here it is.
2976      Romeo is banish'd; and all the world to nothing,
2977      That he dares ne'er come back to challenge you;
2978      Or, if he do, it needs must be by stealth.
2979      Then, since the case so stands as now it doth,
2980      I think it best you married with the county.
2981      O, he's a lovely gentleman!
2982      Romeo's a dishclout to him: an eagle, madam,
2983      Hath not so green, so quick, so fair an eye
2984      As Paris hath. Beshrew my very heart,
2985      I think you are happy in this second match,
2986      For it excels your first: or if it did not,
2987      Your first is dead; or 'twere as good he were,
2988      As living here and you no use of him.
2989      JULIET    
2990      Speakest thou from thy heart?
2991      Nurse     
2992      And from my soul too;
2993      Or else beshrew them both.
2994      JULIET    
2995      Amen!     
2996      Nurse     
2997      What?     
2998      JULIET    
2999      Well, thou hast comforted me marvellous much.
3000      Go in: and tell my lady I am gone,
3001      Having displeased my father, to Laurence' cell,
3002      To make confession and to be absolved.
3003      Nurse     
3004      Marry, I will; and this is wisely done.
3005      Exit      

3006      JULIET    
3007      Ancient damnation! O most wicked fiend!
3008      Is it more sin to wish me thus forsworn,
3009      Or to dispraise my lord with that same tongue
3010      Which she hath praised him with above compare
3011      So many thousand times? Go, counsellor;
3012      Thou and my bosom henceforth shall be twain.
3013      I'll to the friar, to know his remedy:
3014      If all else fail, myself have power to die.
3015      Exit      

3016      ACT IV

3020      On Thursday, sir? the time is very short.
3021      PARIS     
3022      My father Capulet will have it so;
3023      And I am nothing slow to slack his haste.
3024      FRIAR LAURENCE
3025      You say you do not know the lady's mind:
3026      Uneven is the course, I like it not.
3027      PARIS     
3028      Immoderately she weeps for Tybalt's death,
3029      And therefore have I little talk'd of love;
3030      For Venus smiles not in a house of tears.
3031      Now, sir, her father counts it dangerous
3032      That she doth give her sorrow so much sway,
3033      And in his wisdom hastes our marriage,
3034      To stop the inundation of her tears;
3035      Which, too much minded by herself alone,
3036      May be put from her by society:
3037      Now do you know the reason of this haste.
3038      FRIAR LAURENCE
3039      [Aside] I would I knew not why it should be slow'd.
3040      Look, sir, here comes the lady towards my cell.
3041      Enter JULIET

3042      PARIS     
3043      Happily met, my lady and my wife!
3044      JULIET    
3045      That may be, sir, when I may be a wife.
3046      PARIS     
3047      That may be must be, love, on Thursday next.
3048      JULIET    
3049      What must be shall be.
3050      FRIAR LAURENCE
3051      That's a certain text.
3052      PARIS     
3053      Come you to make confession to this father?
3054      JULIET    
3055      To answer that, I should confess to you.
3056      PARIS     
3057      Do not deny to him that you love me.
3058      JULIET    
3059      I will confess to you that I love him.
3060      PARIS     
3061      So will ye, I am sure, that you love me.
3062      JULIET    
3063      If I do so, it will be of more price,
3064      Being spoke behind your back, than to your face.
3065      PARIS     
3066      Poor soul, thy face is much abused with tears.
3067      JULIET    
3068      The tears have got small victory by that;
3069      For it was bad enough before their spite.
3070      PARIS     
3071      Thou wrong'st it, more than tears, with that report.
3072      JULIET    
3073      That is no slander, sir, which is a truth;
3074      And what I spake, I spake it to my face.
3075      PARIS     
3076      Thy face is mine, and thou hast slander'd it.
3077      JULIET    
3078      It may be so, for it is not mine own.
3079      Are you at leisure, holy father, now;
3080      Or shall I come to you at evening mass?
3081      FRIAR LAURENCE
3082      My leisure serves me, pensive daughter, now.
3083      My lord, we must entreat the time alone.
3084      PARIS     
3085      God shield I should disturb devotion!
3086      Juliet, on Thursday early will I rouse ye:
3087      Till then, adieu; and keep this holy kiss.
3088      Exit      

3089      JULIET    
3090      O shut the door! and when thou hast done so,
3091      Come weep with me; past hope, past cure, past help!
3092      FRIAR LAURENCE
3093      Ah, Juliet, I already know thy grief;
3094      It strains me past the compass of my wits:
3095      I hear thou must, and nothing may prorogue it,
3096      On Thursday next be married to this county.
3097      JULIET    
3098      Tell me not, friar, that thou hear'st of this,
3099      Unless thou tell me how I may prevent it:
3100      If, in thy wisdom, thou canst give no help,
3101      Do thou but call my resolution wise,
3102      And with this knife I'll help it presently.
3103      God join'd my heart and Romeo's, thou our hands;
3104      And ere this hand, by thee to Romeo seal'd,
3105      Shall be the label to another deed,
3106      Or my true heart with treacherous revolt
3107      Turn to another, this shall slay them both:
3108      Therefore, out of thy long-experienced time,
3109      Give me some present counsel, or, behold,
3110      'Twixt my extremes and me this bloody knife
3111      Shall play the umpire, arbitrating that
3112      Which the commission of thy years and art
3113      Could to no issue of true honour bring.
3114      Be not so long to speak; I long to die,
3115      If what thou speak'st speak not of remedy.
3116      FRIAR LAURENCE
3117      Hold, daughter: I do spy a kind of hope,
3118      Which craves as desperate an execution.
3119      As that is desperate which we would prevent.
3120      If, rather than to marry County Paris,
3121      Thou hast the strength of will to slay thyself,
3122      Then is it likely thou wilt undertake
3123      A thing like death to chide away this shame,
3124      That copest with death himself to scape from it:
3125      And, if thou darest, I'll give thee remedy.
3126      JULIET    
3127      O, bid me leap, rather than marry Paris,
3128      From off the battlements of yonder tower;
3129      Or walk in thievish ways; or bid me lurk
3130      Where serpents are; chain me with roaring bears;
3131      Or shut me nightly in a charnel-house,
3132      O'er-cover'd quite with dead men's rattling bones,
3133      With reeky shanks and yellow chapless skulls;
3134      Or bid me go into a new-made grave
3135      And hide me with a dead man in his shroud;
3136      Things that, to hear them told, have made me tremble;
3137      And I will do it without fear or doubt,
3138      To live an unstain'd wife to my sweet love.
3139      FRIAR LAURENCE
3140      Hold, then; go home, be merry, give consent
3141      To marry Paris: Wednesday is to-morrow:
3142      To-morrow night look that thou lie alone;
3143      Let not thy nurse lie with thee in thy chamber:
3144      Take thou this vial, being then in bed,
3145      And this distilled liquor drink thou off;
3146      When presently through all thy veins shall run
3147      A cold and drowsy humour, for no pulse
3148      Shall keep his native progress, but surcease:
3149      No warmth, no breath, shall testify thou livest;
3150      The roses in thy lips and cheeks shall fade
3151      To paly ashes, thy eyes' windows fall,
3152      Like death, when he shuts up the day of life;
3153      Each part, deprived of supple government,
3154      Shall, stiff and stark and cold, appear like death:
3155      And in this borrow'd likeness of shrunk death
3156      Thou shalt continue two and forty hours,
3157      And then awake as from a pleasant sleep.
3158      Now, when the bridegroom in the morning comes
3159      To rouse thee from thy bed, there art thou dead:
3160      Then, as the manner of our country is,
3161      In thy best robes uncover'd on the bier
3162      Thou shalt be borne to that same ancient vault
3163      Where all the kindred of the Capulets lie.
3164      In the mean time, against thou shalt awake,
3165      Shall Romeo by my letters know our drift,
3166      And hither shall he come: and he and I
3167      Will watch thy waking, and that very night
3168      Shall Romeo bear thee hence to Mantua.
3169      And this shall free thee from this present shame;
3170      If no inconstant toy, nor womanish fear,
3171      Abate thy valour in the acting it.
3172      JULIET    
3173      Give me, give me! O, tell not me of fear!
3174      FRIAR LAURENCE
3175      Hold; get you gone, be strong and prosperous
3176      In this resolve: I'll send a friar with speed
3177      To Mantua, with my letters to thy lord.
3178      JULIET    
3179      Love give me strength! and strength shall help afford.
3180      Farewell, dear father!
3181      Exeunt    

3182      SCENE II. Hall in Capulet's house.
3183      Enter CAPULET, LADY CAPULET, Nurse, and two Servingmen
3184      CAPULET   
3185      So many guests invite as here are writ.
3186      Exit First Servant

3187      Sirrah, go hire me twenty cunning cooks.
3188      Second Servant
3189      You shall have none ill, sir; for I'll try if they
3190      can lick their fingers.
3191      CAPULET   
3192      How canst thou try them so?
3193      Second Servant
3194      Marry, sir, 'tis an ill cook that cannot lick his
3195      own fingers: therefore he that cannot lick his
3196      fingers goes not with me.
3197      CAPULET   
3198      Go, be gone.
3199      Exit Second Servant

3200      We shall be much unfurnished for this time.
3201      What, is my daughter gone to Friar Laurence?
3202      Nurse     
3203      Ay, forsooth.
3204      CAPULET   
3205      Well, he may chance to do some good on her:
3206      A peevish self-will'd harlotry it is.
3207      Nurse     
3208      See where she comes from shrift with merry look.
3209      Enter JULIET

3210      CAPULET   
3211      How now, my headstrong! where have you been gadding?
3212      JULIET    
3213      Where I have learn'd me to repent the sin
3214      Of disobedient opposition
3215      To you and your behests, and am enjoin'd
3216      By holy Laurence to fall prostrate here,
3217      And beg your pardon: pardon, I beseech you!
3218      Henceforward I am ever ruled by you.
3219      CAPULET   
3220      Send for the county; go tell him of this:
3221      I'll have this knot knit up to-morrow morning.
3222      JULIET    
3223      I met the youthful lord at Laurence' cell;
3224      And gave him what becomed love I might,
3225      Not step o'er the bounds of modesty.
3226      CAPULET   
3227      Why, I am glad on't; this is well: stand up:
3228      This is as't should be. Let me see the county;
3229      Ay, marry, go, I say, and fetch him hither.
3230      Now, afore God! this reverend holy friar,
3231      Our whole city is much bound to him.
3232      JULIET    
3233      Nurse, will you go with me into my closet,
3234      To help me sort such needful ornaments
3235      As you think fit to furnish me to-morrow?
3236      LADY CAPULET
3237      No, not till Thursday; there is time enough.
3238      CAPULET   
3239      Go, nurse, go with her: we'll to church to-morrow.
3240      Exeunt JULIET and Nurse

3241      LADY CAPULET
3242      We shall be short in our provision:
3243      'Tis now near night.
3244      CAPULET   
3245      Tush, I will stir about,
3246      And all things shall be well, I warrant thee, wife:
3247      Go thou to Juliet, help to deck up her;
3248      I'll not to bed to-night; let me alone;
3249      I'll play the housewife for this once. What, ho!
3250      They are all forth. Well, I will walk myself
3251      To County Paris, to prepare him up
3252      Against to-morrow: my heart is wondrous light,
3253      Since this same wayward girl is so reclaim'd.
3254      Exeunt    

3255      SCENE III. Juliet's chamber.
3256      Enter JULIET and Nurse
3257      JULIET    
3258      Ay, those attires are best: but, gentle nurse,
3259      I pray thee, leave me to my self to-night,
3260      For I have need of many orisons
3261      To move the heavens to smile upon my state,
3262      Which, well thou know'st, is cross, and full of sin.
3263      Enter LADY CAPULET

3264      LADY CAPULET
3265      What, are you busy, ho? need you my help?
3266      JULIET    
3267      No, madam; we have cull'd such necessaries
3268      As are behoveful for our state to-morrow:
3269      So please you, let me now be left alone,
3270      And let the nurse this night sit up with you;
3271      For, I am sure, you have your hands full all,
3272      In this so sudden business.
3273      LADY CAPULET
3274      Good night:
3275      Get thee to bed, and rest; for thou hast need.
3276      Exeunt LADY CAPULET and Nurse

3277      JULIET    
3278      Farewell! God knows when we shall meet again.
3279      I have a faint cold fear thrills through my veins,
3280      That almost freezes up the heat of life:
3281      I'll call them back again to comfort me:
3282      Nurse! What should she do here?
3283      My dismal scene I needs must act alone.
3284      Come, vial.
3285      What if this mixture do not work at all?
3286      Shall I be married then to-morrow morning?
3287      No, no: this shall forbid it: lie thou there.
3288      Laying down her dagger

3289      What if it be a poison, which the friar
3290      Subtly hath minister'd to have me dead,
3291      Lest in this marriage he should be dishonour'd,
3292      Because he married me before to Romeo?
3293      I fear it is: and yet, methinks, it should not,
3294      For he hath still been tried a holy man.
3295      How if, when I am laid into the tomb,
3296      I wake before the time that Romeo
3297      Come to redeem me? there's a fearful point!
3298      Shall I not, then, be stifled in the vault,
3299      To whose foul mouth no healthsome air breathes in,
3300      And there die strangled ere my Romeo comes?
3301      Or, if I live, is it not very like,
3302      The horrible conceit of death and night,
3303      Together with the terror of the place,--
3304      As in a vault, an ancient receptacle,
3305      Where, for these many hundred years, the bones
3306      Of all my buried ancestors are packed:
3307      Where bloody Tybalt, yet but green in earth,
3308      Lies festering in his shroud; where, as they say,
3309      At some hours in the night spirits resort;--
3310      Alack, alack, is it not like that I,
3311      So early waking, what with loathsome smells,
3312      And shrieks like mandrakes' torn out of the earth,
3313      That living mortals, hearing them, run mad:--
3314      O, if I wake, shall I not be distraught,
3315      Environed with all these hideous fears?
3316      And madly play with my forefather's joints?
3317      And pluck the mangled Tybalt from his shroud?
3318      And, in this rage, with some great kinsman's bone,
3319      As with a club, dash out my desperate brains?
3320      O, look! methinks I see my cousin's ghost
3321      Seeking out Romeo, that did spit his body
3322      Upon a rapier's point: stay, Tybalt, stay!
3323      Romeo, I come! this do I drink to thee.
3324      She falls upon her bed, within the curtains

3325      SCENE IV. Hall in Capulet's house.
3326      Enter LADY CAPULET and Nurse
3327      LADY CAPULET
3328      Hold, take these keys, and fetch more spices, nurse.
3329      Nurse     
3330      They call for dates and quinces in the pastry.
3331      Enter CAPULET

3332      CAPULET   
3333      Come, stir, stir, stir! the second cock hath crow'd,
3334      The curfew-bell hath rung, 'tis three o'clock:
3335      Look to the baked meats, good Angelica:
3336      Spare not for the cost.
3337      Nurse     
3338      Go, you cot-quean, go,
3339      Get you to bed; faith, You'll be sick to-morrow
3340      For this night's watching.
3341      CAPULET   
3342      No, not a whit: what! I have watch'd ere now
3343      All night for lesser cause, and ne'er been sick.
3344      LADY CAPULET
3345      Ay, you have been a mouse-hunt in your time;
3346      But I will watch you from such watching now.
3347      Exeunt LADY CAPULET and Nurse

3348      CAPULET   
3349      A jealous hood, a jealous hood!
3350      Enter three or four Servingmen, with spits, logs, and baskets

3351      Now, fellow,
3352      What's there?
3353      First Servant
3354      Things for the cook, sir; but I know not what.
3355      CAPULET   
3356      Make haste, make haste.
3357      Exit First Servant

3358      Sirrah, fetch drier logs:
3359      Call Peter, he will show thee where they are.
3360      Second Servant
3361      I have a head, sir, that will find out logs,
3362      And never trouble Peter for the matter.
3363      Exit      

3364      CAPULET   
3365      Mass, and well said; a merry whoreson, ha!
3366      Thou shalt be logger-head. Good faith, 'tis day:
3367      The county will be here with music straight,
3368      For so he said he would: I hear him near.
3369      Music within

3370      Nurse! Wife! What, ho! What, nurse, I say!
3371      Re-enter Nurse

3372      Go waken Juliet, go and trim her up;
3373      I'll go and chat with Paris: hie, make haste,
3374      Make haste; the bridegroom he is come already:
3375      Make haste, I say.
3376      Exeunt    

3377      SCENE V. Juliet's chamber.
3378      Enter Nurse
3379      Nurse     
3380      Mistress! what, mistress! Juliet! fast, I warrant her, she:
3381      Why, lamb! why, lady! fie, you slug-a-bed!
3382      Why, love, I say! madam! sweet-heart! why, bride!
3383      What, not a word? you take your pennyworths now;
3384      Sleep for a week; for the next night, I warrant,
3385      The County Paris hath set up his rest,
3386      That you shall rest but little. God forgive me,
3387      Marry, and amen, how sound is she asleep!
3388      I must needs wake her. Madam, madam, madam!
3389      Ay, let the county take you in your bed;
3390      He'll fright you up, i' faith. Will it not be?
3391      Undraws the curtains

3392      What, dress'd! and in your clothes! and down again!
3393      I must needs wake you; Lady! lady! lady!
3394      Alas, alas! Help, help! my lady's dead!
3395      O, well-a-day, that ever I was born!
3396      Some aqua vitae, ho! My lord! my lady!
3397      Enter LADY CAPULET

3398      LADY CAPULET
3399      What noise is here?
3400      Nurse     
3401      O lamentable day!
3402      LADY CAPULET
3403      What is the matter?
3404      Nurse     
3405      Look, look! O heavy day!
3406      LADY CAPULET
3407      O me, O me! My child, my only life,
3408      Revive, look up, or I will die with thee!
3409      Help, help! Call help.
3410      Enter CAPULET

3411      CAPULET   
3412      For shame, bring Juliet forth; her lord is come.
3413      Nurse     
3414      She's dead, deceased, she's dead; alack the day!
3415      LADY CAPULET
3416      Alack the day, she's dead, she's dead, she's dead!
3417      CAPULET   
3418      Ha! let me see her: out, alas! she's cold:
3419      Her blood is settled, and her joints are stiff;
3420      Life and these lips have long been separated:
3421      Death lies on her like an untimely frost
3422      Upon the sweetest flower of all the field.
3423      Nurse     
3424      O lamentable day!
3425      LADY CAPULET
3426      O woful time!
3427      CAPULET   
3428      Death, that hath ta'en her hence to make me wail,
3429      Ties up my tongue, and will not let me speak.
3430      Enter FRIAR LAURENCE and PARIS, with Musicians

3431      FRIAR LAURENCE
3432      Come, is the bride ready to go to church?
3433      CAPULET   
3434      Ready to go, but never to return.
3435      O son! the night before thy wedding-day
3436      Hath Death lain with thy wife. There she lies,
3437      Flower as she was, deflowered by him.
3438      Death is my son-in-law, Death is my heir;
3439      My daughter he hath wedded: I will die,
3440      And leave him all; life, living, all is Death's.
3441      PARIS     
3442      Have I thought long to see this morning's face,
3443      And doth it give me such a sight as this?
3444      LADY CAPULET
3445      Accursed, unhappy, wretched, hateful day!
3446      Most miserable hour that e'er time saw
3447      In lasting labour of his pilgrimage!
3448      But one, poor one, one poor and loving child,
3449      But one thing to rejoice and solace in,
3450      And cruel death hath catch'd it from my sight!
3451      Nurse     
3452      O woe! O woful, woful, woful day!
3453      Most lamentable day, most woful day,
3454      That ever, ever, I did yet behold!
3455      O day! O day! O day! O hateful day!
3456      Never was seen so black a day as this:
3457      O woful day, O woful day!
3458      PARIS     
3459      Beguiled, divorced, wronged, spited, slain!
3460      Most detestable death, by thee beguil'd,
3461      By cruel cruel thee quite overthrown!
3462      O love! O life! not life, but love in death!
3463      CAPULET   
3464      Despised, distressed, hated, martyr'd, kill'd!
3465      Uncomfortable time, why camest thou now
3466      To murder, murder our solemnity?
3467      O child! O child! my soul, and not my child!
3468      Dead art thou! Alack! my child is dead;
3469      And with my child my joys are buried.
3470      FRIAR LAURENCE
3471      Peace, ho, for shame! confusion's cure lives not
3472      In these confusions. Heaven and yourself
3473      Had part in this fair maid; now heaven hath all,
3474      And all the better is it for the maid:
3475      Your part in her you could not keep from death,
3476      But heaven keeps his part in eternal life.
3477      The most you sought was her promotion;
3478      For 'twas your heaven she should be advanced:
3479      And weep ye now, seeing she is advanced
3480      Above the clouds, as high as heaven itself?
3481      O, in this love, you love your child so ill,
3482      That you run mad, seeing that she is well:
3483      She's not well married that lives married long;
3484      But she's best married that dies married young.
3485      Dry up your tears, and stick your rosemary
3486      On this fair corse; and, as the custom is,
3487      In all her best array bear her to church:
3488      For though fond nature bids us an lament,
3489      Yet nature's tears are reason's merriment.
3490      CAPULET   
3491      All things that we ordained festival,
3492      Turn from their office to black funeral;
3493      Our instruments to melancholy bells,
3494      Our wedding cheer to a sad burial feast,
3495      Our solemn hymns to sullen dirges change,
3496      Our bridal flowers serve for a buried corse,
3497      And all things change them to the contrary.
3498      FRIAR LAURENCE
3499      Sir, go you in; and, madam, go with him;
3500      And go, Sir Paris; every one prepare
3501      To follow this fair corse unto her grave:
3502      The heavens do lour upon you for some ill;
3503      Move them no more by crossing their high will.
3504      Exeunt CAPULET, LADY CAPULET, PARIS, and FRIAR LAURENCE

3505      First Musician
3506      Faith, we may put up our pipes, and be gone.
3507      Nurse     
3508      Honest goodfellows, ah, put up, put up;
3509      For, well you know, this is a pitiful case.
3510      Exit      

3511      First Musician
3512      Ay, by my troth, the case may be amended.
3513      Enter PETER

3514      PETER     
3515      Musicians, O, musicians, 'Heart's ease, Heart's
3516      ease:' O, an you will have me live, play 'Heart's ease.'
3517      First Musician
3518      Why 'Heart's ease?'
3519      PETER     
3520      O, musicians, because my heart itself plays 'My
3521      heart is full of woe:' O, play me some merry dump,
3522      to comfort me.
3523      First Musician
3524      Not a dump we; 'tis no time to play now.
3525      PETER     
3526      You will not, then?
3527      First Musician
3528      No.       
3529      PETER     
3530      I will then give it you soundly.
3531      First Musician
3532      What will you give us?
3533      PETER     
3534      No money, on my faith, but the gleek;
3535      I will give you the minstrel.
3536      First Musician
3537      Then I will give you the serving-creature.
3538      PETER     
3539      Then will I lay the serving-creature's dagger on
3540      your pate. I will carry no crotchets: I'll re you,
3541      I'll fa you; do you note me?
3542      First Musician
3543      An you re us and fa us, you note us.
3544      Second Musician
3545      Pray you, put up your dagger, and put out your wit.
3546      PETER     
3547      Then have at you with my wit! I will dry-beat you
3548      with an iron wit, and put up my iron dagger. Answer
3549      me like men:
3550      'When griping grief the heart doth wound,
3551      And doleful dumps the mind oppress,
3552      Then music with her silver sound'--
3553      why 'silver sound'? why 'music with her silver
3554      sound'? What say you, Simon Catling?
3555      Musician  
3556      Marry, sir, because silver hath a sweet sound.
3557      PETER     
3558      Pretty! What say you, Hugh Rebeck?
3559      Second Musician
3560      I say 'silver sound,' because musicians sound for silver.
3561      PETER     
3562      Pretty too! What say you, James Soundpost?
3563      Third Musician
3564      Faith, I know not what to say.
3565      PETER     
3566      O, I cry you mercy; you are the singer: I will say
3567      for you. It is 'music with her silver sound,'
3568      because musicians have no gold for sounding:
3569      'Then music with her silver sound
3570      With speedy help doth lend redress.'
3571      Exit      

3572      First Musician
3573      What a pestilent knave is this same!
3574      Second Musician
3575      Hang him, Jack! Come, we'll in here; tarry for the
3576      mourners, and stay dinner.
3577      Exeunt    

3578      ACT V     
3579      SCENE I. Mantua. A street.
3580      Enter ROMEO
3581      ROMEO     
3582      If I may trust the flattering truth of sleep,
3583      My dreams presage some joyful news at hand:
3584      My bosom's lord sits lightly in his throne;
3585      And all this day an unaccustom'd spirit
3586      Lifts me above the ground with cheerful thoughts.
3587      I dreamt my lady came and found me dead--
3588      Strange dream, that gives a dead man leave
3589      to think!--
3590      And breathed such life with kisses in my lips,
3591      That I revived, and was an emperor.
3592      Ah me! how sweet is love itself possess'd,
3593      When but love's shadows are so rich in joy!
3594      Enter BALTHASAR, booted

3595      News from Verona!--How now, Balthasar!
3596      Dost thou not bring me letters from the friar?
3597      How doth my lady? Is my father well?
3598      How fares my Juliet? that I ask again;
3599      For nothing can be ill, if she be well.
3600      BALTHASAR 
3601      Then she is well, and nothing can be ill:
3602      Her body sleeps in Capel's monument,
3603      And her immortal part with angels lives.
3604      I saw her laid low in her kindred's vault,
3605      And presently took post to tell it you:
3606      O, pardon me for bringing these ill news,
3607      Since you did leave it for my office, sir.
3608      ROMEO     
3609      Is it even so? then I defy you, stars!
3610      Thou know'st my lodging: get me ink and paper,
3611      And hire post-horses; I will hence to-night.
3612      BALTHASAR 
3613      I do beseech you, sir, have patience:
3614      Your looks are pale and wild, and do import
3615      Some misadventure.
3616      ROMEO     
3617      Tush, thou art deceived:
3618      Leave me, and do the thing I bid thee do.
3619      Hast thou no letters to me from the friar?
3620      BALTHASAR 
3621      No, my good lord.
3622      ROMEO     
3623      No matter: get thee gone,
3624      And hire those horses; I'll be with thee straight.
3625      Exit BALTHASAR

3626      Well, Juliet, I will lie with thee to-night.
3627      Let's see for means: O mischief, thou art swift
3628      To enter in the thoughts of desperate men!
3629      I do remember an apothecary,--
3630      And hereabouts he dwells,--which late I noted
3631      In tatter'd weeds, with overwhelming brows,
3632      Culling of simples; meagre were his looks,
3633      Sharp misery had worn him to the bones:
3634      And in his needy shop a tortoise hung,
3635      An alligator stuff'd, and other skins
3636      Of ill-shaped fishes; and about his shelves
3637      A beggarly account of empty boxes,
3638      Green earthen pots, bladders and musty seeds,
3639      Remnants of packthread and old cakes of roses,
3640      Were thinly scatter'd, to make up a show.
3641      Noting this penury, to myself I said
3642      'An if a man did need a poison now,
3643      Whose sale is present death in Mantua,
3644      Here lives a caitiff wretch would sell it him.'
3645      O, this same thought did but forerun my need;
3646      And this same needy man must sell it me.
3647      As I remember, this should be the house.
3648      Being holiday, the beggar's shop is shut.
3649      What, ho! apothecary!
3650      Enter Apothecary

3651      Apothecary
3652      Who calls so loud?
3653      ROMEO     
3654      Come hither, man. I see that thou art poor:
3655      Hold, there is forty ducats: let me have
3656      A dram of poison, such soon-speeding gear
3657      As will disperse itself through all the veins
3658      That the life-weary taker may fall dead
3659      And that the trunk may be discharged of breath
3660      As violently as hasty powder fired
3661      Doth hurry from the fatal cannon's womb.
3662      Apothecary
3663      Such mortal drugs I have; but Mantua's law
3664      Is death to any he that utters them.
3665      ROMEO     
3666      Art thou so bare and full of wretchedness,
3667      And fear'st to die? famine is in thy cheeks,
3668      Need and oppression starveth in thine eyes,
3669      Contempt and beggary hangs upon thy back;
3670      The world is not thy friend nor the world's law;
3671      The world affords no law to make thee rich;
3672      Then be not poor, but break it, and take this.
3673      Apothecary
3674      My poverty, but not my will, consents.
3675      ROMEO     
3676      I pay thy poverty, and not thy will.
3677      Apothecary
3678      Put this in any liquid thing you will,
3679      And drink it off; and, if you had the strength
3680      Of twenty men, it would dispatch you straight.
3681      ROMEO     
3682      There is thy gold, worse poison to men's souls,
3683      Doing more murders in this loathsome world,
3684      Than these poor compounds that thou mayst not sell.
3685      I sell thee poison; thou hast sold me none.
3686      Farewell: buy food, and get thyself in flesh.
3687      Come, cordial and not poison, go with me
3688      To Juliet's grave; for there must I use thee.
3689      Exeunt    

3690      SCENE II. Friar Laurence's cell.
3691      Enter FRIAR JOHN
3692      FRIAR JOHN
3693      Holy Franciscan friar! brother, ho!
3694      Enter FRIAR LAURENCE

3695      FRIAR LAURENCE
3696      This same should be the voice of Friar John.
3697      Welcome from Mantua: what says Romeo?
3698      Or, if his mind be writ, give me his letter.
3699      FRIAR JOHN
3700      Going to find a bare-foot brother out
3701      One of our order, to associate me,
3702      Here in this city visiting the sick,
3703      And finding him, the searchers of the town,
3704      Suspecting that we both were in a house
3705      Where the infectious pestilence did reign,
3706      Seal'd up the doors, and would not let us forth;
3707      So that my speed to Mantua there was stay'd.
3708      FRIAR LAURENCE
3709      Who bare my letter, then, to Romeo?
3710      FRIAR JOHN
3711      I could not send it,--here it is again,--
3712      Nor get a messenger to bring it thee,
3713      So fearful were they of infection.
3714      FRIAR LAURENCE
3715      Unhappy fortune! by my brotherhood,
3716      The letter was not nice but full of charge
3717      Of dear import, and the neglecting it
3718      May do much danger. Friar John, go hence;
3719      Get me an iron crow, and bring it straight
3720      Unto my cell.
3721      FRIAR JOHN
3722      Brother, I'll go and bring it thee.
3723      Exit      

3724      FRIAR LAURENCE
3725      Now must I to the monument alone;
3726      Within three hours will fair Juliet wake:
3727      She will beshrew me much that Romeo
3728      Hath had no notice of these accidents;
3729      But I will write again to Mantua,
3730      And keep her at my cell till Romeo come;
3731      Poor living corse, closed in a dead man's tomb!
3732      Exit      

3733      SCENE III. A churchyard; in it a tomb belonging to the Capulets.
3734      Enter PARIS, and his Page bearing flowers and a torch
3735      PARIS     
3736      Give me thy torch, boy: hence, and stand aloof:
3737      Yet put it out, for I would not be seen.
3738      Under yond yew-trees lay thee all along,
3739      Holding thine ear close to the hollow ground;
3740      So shall no foot upon the churchyard tread,
3741      Being loose, unfirm, with digging up of graves,
3742      But thou shalt hear it: whistle then to me,
3743      As signal that thou hear'st something approach.
3744      Give me those flowers. Do as I bid thee, go.
3745      PAGE      
3746      [Aside] I am almost afraid to stand alone
3747      Here in the churchyard; yet I will adventure.
3748      Retires   

3749      PARIS     
3750      Sweet flower, with flowers thy bridal bed I strew,--
3751      O woe! thy canopy is dust and stones;--
3752      Which with sweet water nightly I will dew,
3753      Or, wanting that, with tears distill'd by moans:
3754      The obsequies that I for thee will keep
3755      Nightly shall be to strew thy grave and weep.
3756      The Page whistles

3757      The boy gives warning something doth approach.
3758      What cursed foot wanders this way to-night,
3759      To cross my obsequies and true love's rite?
3760      What with a torch! muffle me, night, awhile.
3761      Retires   

3762      Enter ROMEO and BALTHASAR, with a torch, mattock, & c

3763      ROMEO     
3764      Give me that mattock and the wrenching iron.
3765      Hold, take this letter; early in the morning
3766      See thou deliver it to my lord and father.
3767      Give me the light: upon thy life, I charge thee,
3768      Whate'er thou hear'st or seest, stand all aloof,
3769      And do not interrupt me in my course.
3770      Why I descend into this bed of death,
3771      Is partly to behold my lady's face;
3772      But chiefly to take thence from her dead finger
3773      A precious ring, a ring that I must use
3774      In dear employment: therefore hence, be gone:
3775      But if thou, jealous, dost return to pry
3776      In what I further shall intend to do,
3777      By heaven, I will tear thee joint by joint
3778      And strew this hungry churchyard with thy limbs:
3779      The time and my intents are savage-wild,
3780      More fierce and more inexorable far
3781      Than empty tigers or the roaring sea.
3782      BALTHASAR 
3783      I will be gone, sir, and not trouble you.
3784      ROMEO     
3785      So shalt thou show me friendship. Take thou that:
3786      Live, and be prosperous: and farewell, good fellow.
3787      BALTHASAR 
3788      [Aside] For all this same, I'll hide me hereabout:
3789      His looks I fear, and his intents I doubt.
3790      Retires   

3791      ROMEO     
3792      Thou detestable maw, thou womb of death,
3793      Gorged with the dearest morsel of the earth,
3794      Thus I enforce thy rotten jaws to open,
3795      And, in despite, I'll cram thee with more food!
3796      Opens the tomb

3797      PARIS     
3798      This is that banish'd haughty Montague,
3799      That murder'd my love's cousin, with which grief,
3800      It is supposed, the fair creature died;
3801      And here is come to do some villanous shame
3802      To the dead bodies: I will apprehend him.
3803      Comes forward

3804      Stop thy unhallow'd toil, vile Montague!
3805      Can vengeance be pursued further than death?
3806      Condemned villain, I do apprehend thee:
3807      Obey, and go with me; for thou must die.
3808      ROMEO     
3809      I must indeed; and therefore came I hither.
3810      Good gentle youth, tempt not a desperate man;
3811      Fly hence, and leave me: think upon these gone;
3812      Let them affright thee. I beseech thee, youth,
3813      Put not another sin upon my head,
3814      By urging me to fury: O, be gone!
3815      By heaven, I love thee better than myself;
3816      For I come hither arm'd against myself:
3817      Stay not, be gone; live, and hereafter say,
3818      A madman's mercy bade thee run away.
3819      PARIS     
3820      I do defy thy conjurations,
3821      And apprehend thee for a felon here.
3822      ROMEO     
3823      Wilt thou provoke me? then have at thee, boy!
3824      They fight

3825      PAGE      
3826      O Lord, they fight! I will go call the watch.
3827      Exit      

3828      PARIS     
3829      O, I am slain!
3830      Falls     

3831      If thou be merciful,
3832      Open the tomb, lay me with Juliet.
3833      Dies      

3834      ROMEO     
3835      In faith, I will. Let me peruse this face.
3836      Mercutio's kinsman, noble County Paris!
3837      What said my man, when my betossed soul
3838      Did not attend him as we rode? I think
3839      He told me Paris should have married Juliet:
3840      Said he not so? or did I dream it so?
3841      Or am I mad, hearing him talk of Juliet,
3842      To think it was so? O, give me thy hand,
3843      One writ with me in sour misfortune's book!
3844      I'll bury thee in a triumphant grave;
3845      A grave? O no! a lantern, slaughter'd youth,
3846      For here lies Juliet, and her beauty makes
3847      This vault a feasting presence full of light.
3848      Death, lie thou there, by a dead man interr'd.
3849      Laying PARIS in the tomb

3850      How oft when men are at the point of death
3851      Have they been merry! which their keepers call
3852      A lightning before death: O, how may I
3853      Call this a lightning? O my love! my wife!
3854      Death, that hath suck'd the honey of thy breath,
3855      Hath had no power yet upon thy beauty:
3856      Thou art not conquer'd; beauty's ensign yet
3857      Is crimson in thy lips and in thy cheeks,
3858      And death's pale flag is not advanced there.
3859      Tybalt, liest thou there in thy bloody sheet?
3860      O, what more favour can I do to thee,
3861      Than with that hand that cut thy youth in twain
3862      To sunder his that was thine enemy?
3863      Forgive me, cousin! Ah, dear Juliet,
3864      Why art thou yet so fair? shall I believe
3865      That unsubstantial death is amorous,
3866      And that the lean abhorred monster keeps
3867      Thee here in dark to be his paramour?
3868      For fear of that, I still will stay with thee;
3869      And never from this palace of dim night
3870      Depart again: here, here will I remain
3871      With worms that are thy chamber-maids; O, here
3872      Will I set up my everlasting rest,
3873      And shake the yoke of inauspicious stars
3874      From this world-wearied flesh. Eyes, look your last!
3875      Arms, take your last embrace! and, lips, O you
3876      The doors of breath, seal with a righteous kiss
3877      A dateless bargain to engrossing death!
3878      Come, bitter conduct, come, unsavoury guide!
3879      Thou desperate pilot, now at once run on
3880      The dashing rocks thy sea-sick weary bark!
3881      Here's to my love!
3882      Drinks    

3883      O true apothecary!
3884      Thy drugs are quick. Thus with a kiss I die.
3885      Dies      

3886      Enter, at the other end of the churchyard, FRIAR LAURENCE, with a lantern, crow, and spade

3887      FRIAR LAURENCE
3888      Saint Francis be my speed! how oft to-night
3889      Have my old feet stumbled at graves! Who's there?
3890      BALTHASAR 
3891      Here's one, a friend, and one that knows you well.
3892      FRIAR LAURENCE
3893      Bliss be upon you! Tell me, good my friend,
3894      What torch is yond, that vainly lends his light
3895      To grubs and eyeless skulls? as I discern,
3896      It burneth in the Capel's monument.
3897      BALTHASAR 
3898      It doth so, holy sir; and there's my master,
3899      One that you love.
3900      FRIAR LAURENCE
3901      Who is it?
3902      BALTHASAR 
3903      Romeo.    
3904      FRIAR LAURENCE
3905      How long hath he been there?
3906      BALTHASAR 
3907      Full half an hour.
3908      FRIAR LAURENCE
3909      Go with me to the vault.
3910      BALTHASAR 
3911      I dare not, sir
3912      My master knows not but I am gone hence;
3913      And fearfully did menace me with death,
3914      If I did stay to look on his intents.
3915      FRIAR LAURENCE
3916      Stay, then; I'll go alone. Fear comes upon me:
3917      O, much I fear some ill unlucky thing.
3918      BALTHASAR 
3919      As I did sleep under this yew-tree here,
3920      I dreamt my master and another fought,
3921      And that my master slew him.
3922      FRIAR LAURENCE
3923      Romeo!    
3924      Advances  

3925      Alack, alack, what blood is this, which stains
3926      The stony entrance of this sepulchre?
3927      What mean these masterless and gory swords
3928      To lie discolour'd by this place of peace?
3929      Enters the tomb

3930      Romeo! O, pale! Who else? what, Paris too?
3931      And steep'd in blood? Ah, what an unkind hour
3932      Is guilty of this lamentable chance!
3933      The lady stirs.
3934      JULIET wakes

3935      JULIET    
3936      O comfortable friar! where is my lord?
3937      I do remember well where I should be,
3938      And there I am. Where is my Romeo?
3939      Noise within

3940      FRIAR LAURENCE
3941      I hear some noise. Lady, come from that nest
3942      Of death, contagion, and unnatural sleep:
3943      A greater power than we can contradict
3944      Hath thwarted our intents. Come, come away.
3945      Thy husband in thy bosom there lies dead;
3946      And Paris too. Come, I'll dispose of thee
3947      Among a sisterhood of holy nuns:
3948      Stay not to question, for the watch is coming;
3949      Come, go, good Juliet,
3950      Noise again

3951      I dare no longer stay.
3952      JULIET    
3953      Go, get thee hence, for I will not away.
3954      Exit FRIAR LAURENCE

3955      What's here? a cup, closed in my true love's hand?
3956      Poison, I see, hath been his timeless end:
3957      O churl! drunk all, and left no friendly drop
3958      To help me after? I will kiss thy lips;
3959      Haply some poison yet doth hang on them,
3960      To make die with a restorative.
3961      Kisses him

3962      Thy lips are warm.
3963      First Watchman
3964      [Within] Lead, boy: which way?
3965      JULIET    
3966      Yea, noise? then I'll be brief. O happy dagger!
3967      Snatching ROMEO's dagger

3968      This is thy sheath;
3969      Stabs herself

3970      there rust, and let me die.
3971      Falls on ROMEO's body, and dies

3972      Enter Watch, with the Page of PARIS

3973      PAGE      
3974      This is the place; there, where the torch doth burn.
3975      First Watchman
3976      The ground is bloody; search about the churchyard:
3977      Go, some of you, whoe'er you find attach.
3978      Pitiful sight! here lies the county slain,
3979      And Juliet bleeding, warm, and newly dead,
3980      Who here hath lain these two days buried.
3981      Go, tell the prince: run to the Capulets:
3982      Raise up the Montagues: some others search:
3983      We see the ground whereon these woes do lie;
3984      But the true ground of all these piteous woes
3985      We cannot without circumstance descry.
3986      Re-enter some of the Watch, with BALTHASAR

3987      Second Watchman
3988      Here's Romeo's man; we found him in the churchyard.
3989      First Watchman
3990      Hold him in safety, till the prince come hither.
3991      Re-enter others of the Watch, with FRIAR LAURENCE

3992      Third Watchman
3993      Here is a friar, that trembles, sighs and weeps:
3994      We took this mattock and this spade from him,
3995      As he was coming from this churchyard side.
3996      First Watchman
3997      A great suspicion: stay the friar too.
3998      Enter the PRINCE and Attendants

3999      PRINCE    
4000      What misadventure is so early up,
4001      That calls our person from our morning's rest?
4002      Enter CAPULET, LADY CAPULET, and others

4003      CAPULET   
4004      What should it be, that they so shriek abroad?
4005      LADY CAPULET
4006      The people in the street cry Romeo,
4007      Some Juliet, and some Paris; and all run,
4008      With open outcry toward our monument.
4009      PRINCE    
4010      What fear is this which startles in our ears?
4011      First Watchman
4012      Sovereign, here lies the County Paris slain;
4013      And Romeo dead; and Juliet, dead before,
4014      Warm and new kill'd.
4015      PRINCE    
4016      Search, seek, and know how this foul murder comes.
4017      First Watchman
4018      Here is a friar, and slaughter'd Romeo's man;
4019      With instruments upon them, fit to open
4020      These dead men's tombs.
4021      CAPULET   
4022      O heavens! O wife, look how our daughter bleeds!
4023      This dagger hath mista'en--for, lo, his house
4024      Is empty on the back of Montague,--
4025      And it mis-sheathed in my daughter's bosom!
4026      LADY CAPULET
4027      O me! this sight of death is as a bell,
4028      That warns my old age to a sepulchre.
4029      Enter MONTAGUE and others

4030      PRINCE    
4031      Come, Montague; for thou art early up,
4032      To see thy son and heir more early down.
4033      MONTAGUE  
4034      Alas, my liege, my wife is dead to-night;
4035      Grief of my son's exile hath stopp'd her breath:
4036      What further woe conspires against mine age?
4037      PRINCE    
4038      Look, and thou shalt see.
4039      MONTAGUE  
4040      O thou untaught! what manners is in this?
4041      To press before thy father to a grave?
4042      PRINCE    
4043      Seal up the mouth of outrage for a while,
4044      Till we can clear these ambiguities,
4045      And know their spring, their head, their
4046      true descent;
4047      And then will I be general of your woes,
4048      And lead you even to death: meantime forbear,
4049      And let mischance be slave to patience.
4050      Bring forth the parties of suspicion.
4051      FRIAR LAURENCE
4052      I am the greatest, able to do least,
4053      Yet most suspected, as the time and place
4054      Doth make against me of this direful murder;
4055      And here I stand, both to impeach and purge
4056      Myself condemned and myself excused.
4057      PRINCE    
4058      Then say at once what thou dost know in this.
4059      FRIAR LAURENCE
4060      I will be brief, for my short date of breath
4061      Is not so long as is a tedious tale.
4062      Romeo, there dead, was husband to that Juliet;
4063      And she, there dead, that Romeo's faithful wife:
4064      I married them; and their stol'n marriage-day
4065      Was Tybalt's dooms-day, whose untimely death
4066      Banish'd the new-made bridegroom from the city,
4067      For whom, and not for Tybalt, Juliet pined.
4068      You, to remove that siege of grief from her,
4069      Betroth'd and would have married her perforce
4070      To County Paris: then comes she to me,
4071      And, with wild looks, bid me devise some mean
4072      To rid her from this second marriage,
4073      Or in my cell there would she kill herself.
4074      Then gave I her, so tutor'd by my art,
4075      A sleeping potion; which so took effect
4076      As I intended, for it wrought on her
4077      The form of death: meantime I writ to Romeo,
4078      That he should hither come as this dire night,
4079      To help to take her from her borrow'd grave,
4080      Being the time the potion's force should cease.
4081      But he which bore my letter, Friar John,
4082      Was stay'd by accident, and yesternight
4083      Return'd my letter back. Then all alone
4084      At the prefixed hour of her waking,
4085      Came I to take her from her kindred's vault;
4086      Meaning to keep her closely at my cell,
4087      Till I conveniently could send to Romeo:
4088      But when I came, some minute ere the time
4089      Of her awaking, here untimely lay
4090      The noble Paris and true Romeo dead.
4091      She wakes; and I entreated her come forth,
4092      And bear this work of heaven with patience:
4093      But then a noise did scare me from the tomb;
4094      And she, too desperate, would not go with me,
4095      But, as it seems, did violence on herself.
4096      All this I know; and to the marriage
4097      Her nurse is privy: and, if aught in this
4098      Miscarried by my fault, let my old life
4099      Be sacrificed, some hour before his time,
4100      Unto the rigour of severest law.
4101      PRINCE    
4102      We still have known thee for a holy man.
4103      Where's Romeo's man? what can he say in this?
4104      BALTHASAR 
4105      I brought my master news of Juliet's death;
4106      And then in post he came from Mantua
4107      To this same place, to this same monument.
4108      This letter he early bid me give his father,
4109      And threatened me with death, going in the vault,
4110      I departed not and left him there.
4111      PRINCE    
4112      Give me the letter; I will look on it.
4113      Where is the county's page, that raised the watch?
4114      Sirrah, what made your master in this place?
4115      PAGE      
4116      He came with flowers to strew his lady's grave;
4117      And bid me stand aloof, and so I did:
4118      Anon comes one with light to ope the tomb;
4119      And by and by my master drew on him;
4120      And then I ran away to call the watch.
4121      PRINCE    
4122      This letter doth make good the friar's words,
4123      Their course of love, the tidings of her death:
4124      And here he writes that he did buy a poison
4125      Of a poor 'pothecary, and therewithal
4126      Came to this vault to die, and lie with Juliet.
4127      Where be these enemies? Capulet! Montague!
4128      See, what a scourge is laid upon your hate,
4129      That heaven finds means to kill your joys with love.
4130      And I for winking at your discords too
4131      Have lost a brace of kinsmen: all are punish'd.
4132      CAPULET   
4133      O brother Montague, give me thy hand:
4134      This is my daughter's jointure, for no more
4135      Can I demand.
4136      MONTAGUE  
4137      But I can give thee more:
4138      For I will raise her statue in pure gold;
4139      That while Verona by that name is known,
4140      There shall no figure at such rate be set
4141      As that of true and faithful Juliet.
4142      CAPULET   
4143      As rich shall Romeo's by his lady's lie;
4144      Poor sacrifices of our enmity!
4145      PRINCE    
4146      A glooming peace this morning with it brings;
4147      The sun, for sorrow, will not show his head:
4148      Go hence, to have more talk of these sad things;
4149      Some shall be pardon'd, and some punished:
4150      For never was a story of more woe
4151      Than this of Juliet and her Romeo.
4152      Exeunt
