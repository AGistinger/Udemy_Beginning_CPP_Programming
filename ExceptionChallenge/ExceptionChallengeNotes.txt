//Exception Handling - Challenge

For this challenge we want to integrate our own user-defined exception class into the Account class hierarcy.

The account classes are provided for you.
Also, the IllegalBalanceException.h file containes the declaration for the IllegalBalanceException class.

What I would like you to do is:

1. Derive IllegalBalanceException from std::exception and implement the what() method to provide an exception message.
    This exception object should be thrown from the Account class constructor when an account object is created with a negative
    balance.
    
2. Derive InsufficentFundsException from std::exception and implement the what() method to provide an exception message.
    This exception object should be thrown if a withdraw results in a negative balance.
    You should throw this exception object from the Account Withdraw method.

That's it - good luck!
Test your code in the main driver.

Have fun and experiment!
