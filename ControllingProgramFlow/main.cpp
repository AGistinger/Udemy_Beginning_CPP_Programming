// Controlling Program Flow
/*
 * Sequence - Each statement followed by each other
 * Selection - Making decisions execute parts of program when conditions are true or false
 * Iteration - Looping, lets you repeat parts of a program
 * 
 * if statement - if condition is true you do something
 * if-else - If a condition is true you do something, if it is false you do something else
 * Nested if statements - If fav football team playing today, if game is on now, then record it
 * Switch statment - Comparing integer based elements
 * Conditional operator - ?: if/else wrapped in an operator
 * 
 * Iteration - Looping
 * for loop
 * range-based for loop - Works for arrays/vectors of items
 * while loop
 * do-while loop
 * continue and break
 * infinite loops - loops forever
 * nested loops - loops within loops
 *
