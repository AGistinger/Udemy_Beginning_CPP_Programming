1. Programming: Principles and Practice Using C++ by Bjarne Stroustrup.
Good book written by the creator of C++. It should be read slowly and deliberately since it can get complex in places.

2. Jumping into C++ by Alex Allain. Nice intro book.

3. C++ How to Program by Deitel and Deitel. Big book with lots of detail - take it slow since the detail can be too much at times.

4. Starting Out with C++ from Control Structures to Objects by Tony Gaddis - nice, pretty easy read for beginners.
