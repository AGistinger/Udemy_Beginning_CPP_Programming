// I/O and Streams - Stream Manipulators Challenge

Formatting Output
==============================================================================================================
I have provided you with the starter source code for this challenge.
In this challenge youa re to display the provided ata in a nicely formatted table.
Your table does not have to match mine, but practice with the format manipulators
so you become comfortable with them.

There are 3 structures provided.  Yes, thse coudl also be classes with public data,
but it's common to use structures when we simply want to model only data and not
operations as we would classes.

The structures work together to create a Tours structure that will contain
information about Tours to South America.
The Tours include Countries, Cities within thsoe countries along with population and cost data for
each city tour.
I know, population? Huh?  I just wanted a big number so that you can format it, OK :)

Please watch the Challenge video for the expected output.  It won't look right if I put it in this
editor because of font style.

In the provided source code I'm giving you some code that displasy teh data from these structures
and the vectors within the structures.  This code uses tabs to format the data and it looks pretty ugly.

Have fun!! Create functions if you like, use constants, whatever you think makes sense!
