/*
The Standard Template Library (STL) - Container Adaptors - Priority Queue

std::priority_queue

-Allows insertions and removal of elements in order from the front of the
 container
-Elements are stored internally as a vector by default
-Elements are inserted in priority order
 (largest value will always be at the front)
-No iterators are supported

#include <queue>

-push - insert an element into sorted order
-pop - removes the top element (greatest)
-top - access the top element (greatest)
-empty - is the queue empty?
-size - number of elements in the queue

std::priority_queue - Initialization

    std::priority_queue<int> pq;  //vector(default)
    
    pq.push(10);
    pq.push(20);
    pq.push(3);
    pq.push(4);
    
    std::cout << pq.top();  //20 (largest)
    pq.pop();  //remove 20
    pq.top();  //10 (largest)
