//Inheritance - Deriving Classes from Existing Classes

C++ derivation syntax

class Base {
    //Base class members...
};

class Derived: access-specifier Base {
    //Derived class members
};

Access-specifier can be: public, private, or protected (private by default)

Types of Inheritance in C++
-Public
    -Most common
    -Establizhes 'is-a' relationship between Derived and Base classes
    -Focused on in this course
-Private and Protected
    -Establishes "derived class has a base class" relationship
    -"is implemented in terms of" relationship
    -One class in terms of another class
    -Different from composition
    -Not being discussed in this course
    
C++ Derivation Syntax

class Account {
    //Account class members...
};

class Savings Account: public Account {
    //Savings_Account class members...
};

Savings_Account 'is-a' Account    

C++ Creating Objects

Account account {};
Account *p_account = new Account();
account.deposit(1000.0);
p_account->withdraw(200.0);
delete p_account;

Savings_Account sav_account {};
Savings_Account *p_sav_account = new Savings_Account();
sav_account.deposit(1000.0);
p_sav_account->withdraw(200.0);
delete p_sav_account;
