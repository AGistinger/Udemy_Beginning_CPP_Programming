//Polymorphism - Final Specifier

The final specifier

C++11 provides the final specifier
-When used at the class level
    -Prevents a class from being derived from or sub-classed

-When used at the method level
    -Prevents virtual method from being overridden in derived classes
    
Example) final specifier

class My_class final
{
    
};

class Derived final : public Base
{
    
};

Example) final method

class A
{
public:
    virtual void do_something();
};

class B : public A 
{
public:
    virtual void do_something() final;  //prevent further overriding
};

class C : Public B
{
public:
    virtual void do_something();  //COMPILER ERROR - can't override
};
